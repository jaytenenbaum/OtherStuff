 Lutheran church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which devastated German lands.  The population of the German states was reduced by about 30%.  The Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was de facto divided into numerous independent principalities. In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 such List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|territories. 
 dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1806, the Imperium was overrun and dissolved as a result of the Napoleonic Wars.

Suffering from the Great Depression of 1929, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, and a long succession of unstable governments, Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government in the early 1930s. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing  , or stab-in-the-back legend, which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty.

===East and West Germany===
  Saar protectorate]] Allies into Federal Republic German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik, or DDR). They were informally known as "West Germany" and "East Germany". East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital,  to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo. 

West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "social market economy", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ( ). West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957. East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via the latters occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politburo|Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service,    and a variety of sub-organisations controlling every aspect of society. A Soviet-style command economy was set up; the GDR later became a Comecon state. 
 East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDRs social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.    The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the Cold War,  hence its fall in 1989, following democratic reforms in Poland and Hungary, became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, German Reunification and Die Wende.

The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz (Basic Law).

===Law===
 , typical officer uniforms and car colors]] Federal Court Federal Labour Federal Social Federal Finance Federal Administrative Court.  The Völkerstrafgesetzbuch regulates the consequences of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, and gives German courts universal jurisdiction in some circumstances. 

Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the general public.  Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges ( ) sit side by side with professional judges.  

Many of the fundamental matters of administrative law remain in the jurisdiction of the states, though most states base their own laws in that area on the 1976 Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz (Administrative Proceedings Act) covering important points of administrative law. The Oberverwaltungsgerichte are the highest level of administrative jurisdiction concerning the state administrations, unless the question of law concerns federal law or state law identical to federal law. In such cases, final appeal to the Federal Administrative Court is possible.

===Foreign relations===
 
  hosting the G8 summit in Heiligendamm]] strong alliance with France since the end of World War II. Germany seeks to advance the creation of a more unified European political, defence, and security apparatus.  

The development policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is an independent area of German foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.  It is the worlds third biggest aid donor after the United States and France.  

During the Cold War, Germanys partition by the Iron Curtain made it a symbol of East-West tensions and a political battleground in Europe. However, Willy Brandts Ostpolitik was a key factor in the détente of the 1970s.  In 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schröders government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking part in the NATO decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since World War II.  The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.    The 1948 Marshall Plan and strong cultural ties have crafted a strong bond between the two countries, although Schröders vocal opposition to the Iraq War suggested the end of Atlanticism and a relative cooling of German-American relations.  The two countries are also economically interdependent: 8.8% of German exports are U.S.-bound and 6.6% of German imports originate from the U.S.

Germanys military, the Bundeswehr, is organized into German Army|Heer (Army), German Navy|Marine (Navy), German Air Force|Luftwaffe (Air Force), Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service and Streitkräftebasis (Joint Support Service) branches. The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany (Art. 87a) as absolutely defensive only. Its only active role before 1990 was the Katastropheneinsatz (disaster control). Within the Bundeswehr, it helped after natural disasters both in Germany and abroad. After 1990, the international situation changed from East-West confrontation to one of general uncertainty and instability. Today, after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term "defense" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world.

 , military spending was an estimated 1.3% of the countrys GDP, which is low in a ranking of all countries; in absolute terms, German military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world.  In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. If Germany went to war, which according to the constitution is allowed only for defensive purposes, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.

==Demographics==
 
 16th most population density life expectancy fertility rate lowest in the world.  Since the 1970s, Germanys death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate.  The Federal Statistical Office of Germany has forecast that the population could shrink to between 65 and 70 million by 2060 (depending on the level of net migration).   
Details on the methodology, detailed tables, etc. are provided at   
However, such forecasts have often been proven wrong in the past, and Germany is currently witnessing increased birth rates  and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. It is notably experiencing a strong increase in the number of well-educated migrants.   In 2012, 300,000 more immigrants than emigrants were reported in Germany. 

Germans by nationality make up 91% of the population of Germany.  , about seven million foreign citizens were registered in Germany, and 20%  , p. 64 statistics  of the countrys residents, or more than 16 million people, were of foreign or partially foreign descent (including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates), 96% of whom lived in the former West Germany or Berlin.  In 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005 – the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background – the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.   

Most of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the pre-unification territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new Länder (including Berlin) where it stood at 15%.  Families with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.
