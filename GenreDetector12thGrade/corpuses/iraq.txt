}} Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. 

Iraq borders Syria to the northwest, Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Jordan to the west, Saudi Arabia to the south and southwest, and Kuwait to the south. Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring   on the northern Persian Gulf. The capital city, Baghdad is in the center-east of the country. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run through the center of Iraq, flowing from northwest to southeast. These provide Iraq with agriculturally capable land and contrast with the steppe and desert landscape that covers most of Western Asia.

==History==
 

===Ancient Iraq===
  bows before Shalmaneser III of Assyria, 825 BCE.]]
  first Cuneiform writing system and recorded history itself were born. The Sumerian civilization flourished for over 3,000 years  and was succeeded by the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC. Over two centuries of Akkadian dominance was followed by a Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC. An Elamite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Third Dynasty of Ur to an end. By the 21st century BC, a new Akkadian civilization, Assyria, had risen to dominance in northern Iraq, and by the 19th century BC a contemporaneous Amorite state, Babylonia, had formed in southern Iraq.

Iraq was to be dominated by the Assyrians and Babylonians for the next 14 centuries, and under the Babylonian empire of Hammurabi, the Assyrian Empires of 13651076 BC and the Neo Assyrian Empire of 911609 BC, and the final Babylonian empire of 620539 BC Iraq became a centre of world power. The Neo Assyrian Empire in particular put Iraq at the heart of a massive empire stretching from the Caucasus to Egypt and Arabia, and from Cyprus to Persia.
 Persia defeated Hellenistic Seleucid Seleucid rule Parthians conquered Romans invaded several times. Sassanid Persians under Ardashir I destroyed the Parthian Empire and conquered the region in 224 AD. The region was thus a province of the Persian Empire for four centuries, until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century, although a number of indigenous states evolved during the Parthian era, such as Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra.

===Middle Ages===
 
The Islamic conquest in the 7th century established Islam in Iraq. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, the prophet Muhammads cousin and son-in-law Ali moved his capital to Kufa "fi al-Iraq" when he became the fourth caliph. The Umayyad Caliphate ruled the province of Iraq from Damascus in the 7th century. (However, eventually there was a separate, independent Caliphate of Crdoba.)
 Arab and multicultural city Mongols destroyed siege of Baghdad in the 13th century. 

  by the Mongols]] Baghdad was decimated.  Estimates of the number of dead range from 200,000 to a million. 

The Mongols destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate and the House of Wisdom, which contained countless precious and historical documents. The city has never regained its status as major center of culture and influence. Some historians believe that the Mongol invasion destroyed much of the irrigation infrastructure that had sustained Mesopotamia for millennia. Other historians point to soil salination as the culprit in the decline in agriculture. 

The mid-14th-century Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world.  The best estimate for the Middle East is a death rate of a third. 

In 1401, warlord of Mongol descent Tamerlane (Timur Lenk) invaded Iraq. After the capture of Baghdad, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred.  Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him (many warriors were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur). 

===Ottoman Iraq===
 
During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Black Sheep Turkmen ruled the area now known as Iraq. In 1466, the White Sheep Turkmen defeated the Black Sheep and took control. In the 16th century, most of the territory of present-day Iraq came under the control of Ottoman Empire as the eyalet of Baghdad. Throughout most of the period of Ottoman rule (15331918) the territory of present-day Iraq was a battle zone between the rival regional empires and tribal alliances. The Safavid dynasty of Iran briefly asserted their hegemony over Iraq in the periods of 15081533 and 16221638.

By the 17th century, the frequent conflicts with the Safavids had sapped the strength of the Ottoman Empire and had weakened its control over its provinces. The nomadic population swelled with the influx of bedouins from Najd, in the Arabian Peninsula. Bedouin raids on settled areas became impossible to curb. 
 Georgian    origin who succeeded in obtaining autonomy from the Ottoman Porte, suppressed tribal revolts, curbed the power of the Janissaries, restored order and introduced a program of modernization of economy and military. In 1831, the Ottomans managed to overthrow the Mamluk regime and imposed their direct control over Iraq. The population of Iraq had shrunk to under 5 million by the early 20th century. 
 British forces captured Baghdad in 1917. An armistice was signed in 1918.

During the subsequent Anglo-Iraqi War, the United Kingdom invaded Iraq for fear that the Rashid Ali government might cut oil supplies to Western nations because of his links to the Axis powers. The war started on 2 May and an armistice was signed 31 May.

A military occupation followed the restoration of the pre-coup government of the Hashemite monarchy. The occupation ended on 26 October 1947. The rulers during the occupation and the remainder of the Hashemite monarchy were Nuri as-Said, the autocratic Prime Minister, who also ruled from 19301932, and Abd al-Ilah, the former Regent who now served as an adviser to King Faisal II.

After the success of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, President Saddam Hussein invaded Iran a year and a half later, initiating the IranIraq War (or First Persian Gulf War). The war ended in stalemate in 1988, largely due to foreign support for Iraq. Between half a million and 1.5 million people from both sides died in the 19801988 war.  With economic loss of more than $500 billion for both sides.
In 1981, Israeli aircraft bombed an Iraqi nuclear materials testing reactor as part of Operation Opera which became widely criticized because of Israels involvement in a foreign conflict. In the final stages of IranIraq War, the Baathist Iraqi regime led the Al-Anfal Campaign, a genocidal    campaign that targeted Iraqi Kurds,    and led to the killing of 50,000  100,000 civilians.

The Iraqi government claimed some inspectors were spies for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  On multiple occasions throughout the disarmament crisis, the UN passed further resolutions (see United Nations Resolutions concerning Iraq) compelling Iraq to comply with the terms of the ceasefire resolutions.

During the late 1990s, the U.N. considered relaxing the Iraq sanctions because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions.

These claims were based on documents that were provided by the CIA and the government of the United Kingdom.  However, according to a comprehensive U.S. government report, no weapons of mass destruction have been found.  The Duelfer Report in 2004 found that Saddam Hussein had halted all nuclear weapons research in 1991, and had ended research into chemical and biological weapons in 1995.   Antiquated warheads containing trace amounts of the nerve gas cyclosarin were found, but U.S. military tests found they would "have limited to no impact if used by insurgents against coalition forces."

U.S. troops continued to work with Iraqi forces after the pullout.  

The Status of Forces Agreement stated that U.S. troops would leave the country on December 31, 2011.  On the morning of December 18, the final contingent of U.S. troops to be withdrawn ceremonially exited over the border to Kuwait,  though the U.S. still maintains two bases and approximately 4,000 troops in the country. 

The Iraqi National Movement, reportedly representing the majority of Iraqi Sunnis, boycotted Parliament for several weeks in late 2011 and early 2012, claiming that the Shiite-dominated government was striving to sideline Sunnis. In January 2012, Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni, fled to the semi-autonomous Kurdish region after the government accused him of running a sectarian death squad; in February, a panel of Iraqi judges concluded that "death squads commanded by Mr. Hashimi carried out 150 attacks over six years against religious pilgrims, security officers and political foes".

==Geography==
 
 
Iraq lies between latitudes 29th parallel north|29 and 38th parallel north|38 N, and longitudes 39th meridian east|39 and 49th meridian east|49 E (a small area lies west of 39). Spanning  , it is the 58th-largest country in the world. It is comparable in size to the US state of California, and somewhat larger than Paraguay.

Iraq mainly consists of desert, but near the two major rivers (Euphrates and Tigris) are fertile alluvial plains, as the rivers carry about   of silt annually to the River delta|delta. The north of the country is mostly composed of mountains; the highest point being at   point, unnamed on the map opposite, but known locally as Cheekah Dar (black tent). Iraq has a small coastline measuring   along the Persian Gulf. Close to the coast and along the Shatt al-Arab (known as arvandrd:  among Iranians) there used to be marshlands, but many were drained in the 1990s.

===Climate===
 
Most of Iraq has a hot arid climate with subtropical influence. Summer temperatures average above   for most of the country and frequently exceed  . Winter temperatures infrequently exceed   with maxima roughly   and night-time lows  . Typically precipitation is low; most places receive less than   annually, with maximum rainfall occurring during the winter months. Rainfall during the summer is extremely rare, except in the far north of the country. The northern mountainous regions have cold winters with occasional heavy snows, sometimes causing extensive flooding.

==Government and politics==

Law no. 188 of the year 1959 (Personal Status Law)  made polygamy extremely difficult, granted child custody to the mother in case of divorce, prohibited repudiation and marriage under the age of 16.    Article 1 of Civil Code also identifies Islamic law as a formal source of law.  Iraq had no Sharia courts but civil courts used Sharia for issues of personal status including marriage and divorce. In 1995 Iraq introduced Sharia punishment for certain types of criminal offenses.  The code is based on French civil law as well as Sunni and Jafari (Shiite) interpretations of Sharia. 

In 2004, the CFA chief executive L. Paul Bremer said he would veto any constitutional draft stating that sharia is the principal basis of law.  The declaration enraged many local Shia clerics,  and by 2005 the United States had relented, allowing a role for sharia in the constitution to help end a stalemate on the draft constitution.

On November 17, 2008, the U.S. and Iraq agreed to a Status of Forces Agreement,  as part of the broader Strategic Framework Agreement.  This agreement states "the Government of Iraq requests" U.S. forces to temporarily remain in Iraq to "maintain security and stability," and that Iraq has jurisdiction over military contractors, and US personnel when not on US bases or onduty.

On 12 February 2009, Iraq officially became the 186th State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Under the provisions of this treaty, Iraq is considered a party with declared stockpiles of chemical weapons. Because of their late accession, Iraq is the only State Party exempt from the existing timeline for destruction of their chemical weapons. Specific criteria is in development to address the unique nature of Iraqi accession.

On November 20, 2004, the Paris Club of creditor nations agreed to write off 80% ($33 billion) of Iraqs $42 billion debt to Club members. Iraqs total external debt was around $120 billion at the time of the 2003 invasion, and had grown another $5 billion by 2004. The debt relief will be implemented in three stages: two of 30% each and one of 20%. 

In February 2011, Citigroup included Iraq in a group of countries which it described as 3G (countries)|Global Growth Generators, that it argued will enjoy significant economic growth in the future.

According to the Overseas Development Institute, international NGOs face challenges in carrying out their mission, leaving their assistance "piecemeal and largely conducted undercover, hindered by insecurity, a lack of coordinated funding, limited operational capacity and patchy information".  International NGOs have been targeted and during the first 5 years, 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. 

===Oil and energy===

With its   of proved oil reserves, Iraq ranks second in the world behind Saudi Arabia in the amount of oil reserves.   Oil production levels reached 3.4 million barrels per day by December 2012.  Iraq intends to increase its production to 5 million barrels per day by 2014.  Only about 2,000 oil wells have been drilled in Iraq, compared with about 1 million wells in Texas alone.  Iraq was one of the founding members of OPEC. 

As of 2010, despite improved security and billions of dollars in oil revenue, Iraq still generates about half the electricity that customers demand, leading to protests during the hot summer months. 

The Iraq oil law is a proposed piece of legislation submitted to the Iraqi Council of Representatives in May 2007.  The Iraqi government has yet to reach an agreement on the law.

According to a US Study from May 2007, between   and   of Iraqs declared oil production over the past four years could have been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling.  In 2008, Al Jazeera reported $13 billion of Iraqi oil revenues in U.S. care was improperly accounted for, of which $2.6 billion is totally unaccounted for.

These plans were canceled in September because negotiations had stalled for so long that the work could not be completed within the time frame, according to Iraqi oil minister Hussain al-Shahristani. Several United States senators had also criticized the deal, arguing it was hindering efforts to pass the hydrocarbon law.
