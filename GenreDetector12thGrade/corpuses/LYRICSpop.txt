Justin Timberlake - Mirrors Lyrics

Send "Mirrors" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Hook]
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Hook 1]
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The biggest scene is set in my heart
There's a space, but now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Break]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
You are, you are the love of my life

[Verse 3]
Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4]
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

[Hook 2]

Pink - Just Give Me a Reason Lyrics
Artist: Pink
Album: The Truth About Love
Send "Just Give Me a Reason" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
Right from the start, you were a thief,
You stole my heart 
And I, your willing victim.
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty.
And with every touch
You fixed them.
Now, you've been talking in your sleep
Oh oh. 
Things you never say to me
Oh oh. 
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
An' we can learn to love again.
It's in the stars,
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again.

I'm sorry I don't understand 
Where all of this is coming from.
I thought that we were fine.
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind.
(Yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh. You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh. There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Ooooh, our love, our love.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent and we can learn to love again.
I never stopped
It's still written in the scars on my heart.
You're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again.

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust,
But our love's enough.
You're holding it in,
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems.
We'll come clean!

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again.
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent 
And we can learn to love again.

Just give me a reason,
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again.
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent 
And we can learn to love again.

Ooh! We can learn to love again
Ooh! We can learn to love again

Oh, that we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Can't Hold Us Lyrics
Artist: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis
Album: The Heist
Send "Can't Hold Us" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack - get up
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
Nope, Nope. y’all can’t copy that
Bad, moonwalkin', This here, is our party
My posse's been on broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money
Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustling
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the 4 track, bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
Labels out here, nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook x2 Ray Dalton]
And then we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah I’m so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me, I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
(Why? Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye
I've got a world to see;
And my girl, She wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like...
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me;
If I fall they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
Then we keep marching, I said

[Hook x2 Ray Dalton]

[Bridge]
And all my people say'
"Na na NAna na naNA na"

[Hook x2 Ray Dalton]

Demi Lovato - Heart Attack Lyrics
Artist: Demi Lovato
Album: Demi
Send "Heart Attack" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
Puttin’ my defences up
‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough

When I don’t care
I can play ‘em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous
And I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m

Puttin’ my defences up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack [x3]

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help

It's just not fair
Brings more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
For you. Make me so nervous
And I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m

Puttin’ my defences up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack [x3]

The feelings are lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So scared I take off in a run
I’m flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow, but I cover up
Won’t let it show, so I’m

Puttin’ my defences up
‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I’d have a heart attack [x5]

Listen while you read!
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the lights it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohhh

i'm in the milky way
you want me down on earth
but i am up in space

you're so damn hard to please
we gotta kill this switch
you're from the 70s but i'm a 90s bitch

i love it

i got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
i crashed my car into the bridge
i watched i let it burn
i threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
i crashed my car into the bridge

i don't care, i love it
i love it, i don't care

Send "When I Was Your Man" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can’t be sure when they’ve hit their mark
Besides in the meantime I’m just dreaming of tearing you apart
I’m in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I’m a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
Light em up
I’m on fire
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I’ve got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you’re the antidote to everything except me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
Light em up
I’m on fire

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
but until the gates are open
I just want to feel this moment (x3)

Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long way from them hard ways
Bill sos, and oh yeas
Day county, always
305, all day
Now baby we cant party (x2)
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie ups
I got her hooked, because she see me in a suit with a red tie tied up
here to please nice to meet-cha
but time is money, the only difference is, i own it
Now lets stop time and enjoy this moment

[Chorus]

I see the future, but live for the moment, makes scene don't it?
I make dollars, I mean billions
I'm a genius, i mean brilliance
This street is what scoot em
And made em slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Zula
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And not given view, and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it, like a stop watch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Hey baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sippin’ on southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin’
Hell I can’t get you out of my head

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yea

We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh uh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights, uh uh
This place is too crowded too many cool kids, 
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh uh

[Featuring: Mac Miller]

What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

So don’t you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
The way you love me

Oh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question (q-question)
Cause boy I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

So don’t you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You’re a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So you’re sleeping in mine.

“American Beauty” or “Bruce Almighty” that's groovy,
Just come and move closer to me

But baby you’re an adventure
So please let me come explore you

So don’t you worry, baby you got me

You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)

I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
The way I love you

The way I love you
The way I love you, you, you, yeah

I love the way you make me feel

Krewella - Alive Lyrics
Artist: Krewella
Album: Play Hard EP
Send "Alive" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
So, tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever,
There's no regretting anymore.
It's worth to wait, even so far away.
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No lights to brake when you're hanging right here
You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind
All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like

Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
Meet me under shining lights, 
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you can't deny that 
you're living open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into 
your crazy laughter
Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I've been chasing after.
All alone, just the beat inside my soul

Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like

Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive
Alive!
I know what it feels like
Come on make me feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive alive alive alive
Alive! Feel alive!

Jason Derulo - The Other Side (Single) Lyrics
Artist: Jason Derulo
Album: The Other Side (Single)
Send "The Other Side (Single)" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Till you were eating off my spoon
And coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

(Woah)
Kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, "We're going all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

(Woah)
Take me to the other side
(Woah)
And take me to the other side
(Woah)
Kiss me like it's do or die
(Woah)
And take me to the other side

Emeli Sandé - Next to Me Lyrics
Artist: Emeli Sandé
Album: Our Version Of Events
Genre: R&B
Send "Next to Me" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
You won’t find him drinking at the table
Rolling dice and staying out til 3
You won’t ever find him being unfaithful
You will find you will find him next to me
You won’t find him trying to change the devil
For money fame power out of grief
You won’t ever find him where the rest go
You will find him find him next to me

Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone’s lost their head all around us
You will find him you’ll find him next to me
Never in my life have i met someone like him
I’m blown away by his love for me
If you ever wonder where it is you’ll find him
You will find him you will find him next to me
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know there’s no need for me to panic
Cause I’ll find him I’ll find him next to me

When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
All i need is a helping hand to stop the tears from
falling
I will find him will find him next to me

Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

Mariah Carey - #Beautiful Lyrics
Artist: Mariah Carey
Album: #Beautiful - Single
Send "#Beautiful" Ringtone to your Cell
Uh (3X) 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 

Hop on the back of my bike 
Let the good wind blow through your hair 
With an ass like that 
And a smile so bright 
Oh, you're killing me 
You know it ain't fair 

Ride on 
Through the middle of the night 
Let the moonlight kiss your skin 
When you dance like that 
Your jeans so tight 
Oh, you're killing me 
Baby, do it again 

You're beautiful 
And your mind is ****ing beautiful 
And I can't pretend that 
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me 
You're beautiful 
Gorgeous, you're ****ing beautiful 
And I can't pretend that 
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me 

I like when you run red lights 
Don't stop 'til you thrill me 
Oh, how you thrill me 
Always in control 
How you do it, I don't know 
But I don't care 
Take me anywhere 

'Cause it's beautiful 
Ooh, you make me feel undressable 
And I can't pretend 
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me 
Oh, you're beautiful 
And your mind is ****ing beautiful 
And I can't pretend that 
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me 

Yes, you're beautiful 
Gorgeous, you're ****ing beautiful 
And I can't pretend 
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me 

Uh (6X) 
You're beautiful 
You know that you're beautiful 
You're beautiful

Avril Lavigne - Here's to Never Growing Up Lyrics
Artist: Avril Lavigne
Album: Here's to Never Growing Up (Single)
Send "Here's to Never Growing Up" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
(Verse) 
There I said it, it`s out of my mouth 
I hope you heard it cause it`s too late now 
Do you get it, that I come unglued 
When I pick up the phone and I see that it`s you 
Don`t wanna rush it but I’m letting you know 
Just what I’m feeling from my head to my toes 
And I can`t help it if I don`t make sense 
But I`ve made up my mind, jumping off of the fence 

(Bridge) 
We can`t deny, 
Boy you and I 
Fit together like a hand in a glove 
Like a kiss and a hug, boy you`re the one 

(Chorus) 
The stars have got an endless sky 
And the melodies got words that rhyme 
And baby I got you 
(I got you, I got you) 
Like Sonny and Cher on the TV screen 
My heart has found the missing piece 
‘Cause baby I got you, I got you 
(I got you, I got you) 

Yea, I got you baby

Justin Timberlake - Suit & Tie Lyrics
Artist: Justin Timberlake
Album: The 20/20 Experience
Send "Suit & Tie" Ringtone to your Cell
Listen while you read!
[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit, tie
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby cause
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

[Ad lib: Timbaland]
Wait a minute. You ready, JT?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going out so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly tonight

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my Thriller, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

[Hook]

[Ad lib: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, get out ya seat, Hov

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant with my rent
Disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, hun!

[Hook]
