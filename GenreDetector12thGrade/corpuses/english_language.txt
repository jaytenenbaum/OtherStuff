Owing to the assimilation of words from many other languages throughout history, modern English contains a very large vocabulary, with complex and irregular spelling, particularly of vowels. Modern English has not only assimilated words from other European languages, but from all over the world. The Oxford English Dictionary lists over 250,000 distinct words, not including many technical, scientific, and slang terms.  

==Etymology==
The word English derives from the eponym Angle, the name of a Germanic tribe thought to originate from the Angeln area of Jutland, now in northern Germany.  For possible etymologies of these words, see the articles Angeln and Angles.

==Significance==
  dominant language international language British colonisation from the 16th to 19th centuries, it became the dominant language in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The growing economic and cultural influence of the US and its status as a global superpower since World War II have significantly accelerated the languages spread across the planet.    German as the dominant language of science Nobel Prize laureates during the second half of the 20th century.  French as the dominant language of diplomacy during the last half of the 19th century.

A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of fields, occupations and professions such as medicine and computing; as a consequence over a billion people speak English to at least a basic level (see English as a second or foreign language). It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. 
 creoles and pidgins have the potential to produce new distinct languages from English over time.   

==History==
 
 North Sea Britain by Germanic settlers Brythonic alongside Roman occupation.  One of these incoming Germanic tribes was the Angles,  whom Bede believed to have relocated entirely to Britain.  The names England (from Engla land  "Land of the Angles") and English (Old English Englisc ) are derived from the name of this tribebut Saxons, Jutes and a range of Germanic peoples from the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland and Southern Sweden also moved to Britain in this era.   
 Late West Saxon, eventually came to dominate, and it is in this that the poem Beowulf is written.
 North Germanic Romance language Old Norman in the 11th century with the Norman conquest of England. Norman developed into Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman, and then Law French|Anglo-French  and introduced a layer of words especially via the courts and government. As well as extending the lexicon with Scandinavian and Norman words these two events also simplified the grammar and transformed English into a borrowing languagemore than normally open to accept new words from other languages.

The linguistic shifts in English following the Norman invasion produced what is now referred to as Middle English; Geoffrey Chaucers The Canterbury Tales is its best-known work. humanist Renaissance Latin, and those that wrote or copied texts in Latin  commonly coined new terms from Latin to refer to things or concepts for which there was no existing native English word.

Modern English, which includes the works of William Shakespeare  and the King James Bible, is generally dated from about 1550, and after the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the lingua franca of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the lingua franca to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. As a result of the growth of the British Empire, English was adopted in North America, India, Africa, Australia and many other regions, a trend extended with the emergence of the United States as a superpower in the mid-20th century.

==Classification and related languages==

===Germanic family=== West Germanic Germanic family, strong and weak classes, Scots (spoken Ulster Scots Frisian (spoken on the southern fringes of the North Sea in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany).
 High German), and the North Germanic languages (Swedish language|Swedish, Danish language|Danish, Norwegian language|Norwegian, Icelandic language|Icelandic, and Faroese language|Faroese). With the (partial) exception of Scots, none of the other languages are mutually intelligible with English, owing in part to the divergences in lexis (linguistics)|lexis, syntax, semantics, and phonology, and to the isolation afforded to the English language by the British Isles, although some, such as Dutch, do show strong affinities with English, especially to earlier stages of the language. Isolation has allowed English and Scots (as well as Icelandic and Faroese) to develop independently of the Continental Germanic languages and their influences over time. 

In addition to isolation, lexical differences between English and other Germanic languages exist due to   continues to survive dialectally) and "change" (French) vs. Dutch andering and German nderung (literally "elsing, othering", i.e. "alteration"); "movement" (French) vs. Dutch beweging and German Bewegung (" -ing", i.e. "proceeding along the way"); etc. With the exception of exit (a Modern English borrowing), Middle English had already distanced itself from other Germanic languages, having the terms wharf, schift (="shift"), and wending for "change"; and already by Old English times the word bewegan meant "to cover, envelop", rather than "to move". Preference of one synonym over another also causes differentiation in lexis, even where both words are Germanic, as in English care vs. German Sorge. Both words descend from Proto-Germanic *kar and *surg respectively, but *kar has become the dominant word in English for "care" while in German, Dutch, and Scandinavian languages, the *surg root prevailed. *Surg still survives in English, however, as sorrow.

Despite extensive lexical borrowing, the workings of the English language are resolutely Germanic, and English remains classified as a Germanic language due to its structure and grammar. Borrowed words get incorporated into a Germanic system of conjugation, declension, and syntax, and behave exactly as though they were native Germanic words from Old English. For example, the word reduce is borrowed from Latin redcere; however, in English one says "I reduce  I reduced  I will reduce" rather than "redc  redx  redcam"; likewise, we say: "Johns life insurance company" (cf. Dutch "Johns levensverzekeringsmaatschappij"   rather than "the company of insurance life of John", cf. the French: la compagnie dassurance-vie de John). Furthermore, in English, all basic grammatical particles added to nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are Germanic. For nouns, these include the normal plural marker -s/-es (apple  apples; cf. Frisian appel  appels; Dutch appel  appels; Afrikaans appel  appels), and the possessive markers  -s (Brads hat; German Brads Hut; Danish Brads hat) and -s .
 zero or null (-) affixes, derive from endings which previously existed in Old English (usually -e, -a, -u, -o, -an, etc.), that later weakened to -e, and have since ceased to be pronounced and spelt (e.g. Modern English "I sing" = I sing- < I singe < Old English ic singe; "we thought" = we thought- < we thoughte(n) < Old English w hton).

===Old Norse impact===
Due to the Viking colonisation and influence of Old Norse upon Middle English, English syntax follows a pattern similar to that of North Germanic languages (Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, etc.) in contrast to other West Germanic languages, such as Dutch and German. This is especially evident in the order and placement of verbs. For example, English "I will never see you again" = Danish "Jeg vil aldrig se dig igen"; Icelandic "g mun aldrei sj ig aftur", whereas in Dutch and German the main verb is placed at the end (e.g. Dutch "Ik zal je nooit weer zien"; German "Ich werde dich nie wieder sehen", literally, "I will you never again see"). This is also observable in perfect tense constructions, as in English "I have never seen anything in the square" = Danish "Jeg har aldrig set noget p torvet"; Icelandic "g hef aldrei s neitt  torginu", where Dutch and German place the past participle at the end (e.g. Dutch "Ik heb nooit iets op het plein  gezien"; German "Ich habe nie etwas auf dem Platz gesehen", literally, "I have never anything in the square seen"). As in most Germanic languages, English adjectives usually come before the noun they modify, even when the adjective is of Latinate origin (e.g. medical emergency, national treasure). Also, English continues to make extensive use of English compound|self-explaining compounds (e.g. streetcar, classroom), and nouns which serve as modifiers (e.g. lamp post, life insurance company), traits inherited from Old English (See also Kenning).

The kinship with other Germanic languages can also be seen in the tensing of English verbs (e.g. English fall/fell/fallen/will or shall fall, West Frisian fal/foel/fallen/sil falle, Dutch vallen/viel/gevallen/zullen vallen, German fallen/fiel/gefallen/werden fallen, Norwegian faller/falt/falt or falne/vil or skal falle), the comparatives of adjectives and adverbs (e.g. English good/better/best, West Frisian goed/better/best, Dutch goed/beter/best, German gut/besser/best), the treatment of nouns (English shoemaker, shoemakers, shoemakers, shoemakers; Dutch schoenmaker, schoenmakers, schoenmakers, schoenmakeren; Swedish skomakare, skomakares, skomakare, skomakares),  and the large amount of cognates (e.g. English wet, Scots weet, West Frisian wiet, Swedish vt; English send, Dutch zenden, German senden; English meaning, Swedish mening, Icelandic meining, etc.).

It occasionally gives rise to false friends (e.g. English time vs Norwegian time, meaning "hour"; English gift vs German Gift, meaning "poison"), while differences in phonology can obscure words that really are related (tooth vs. German Zahn; compare also Danish tand, North Frisian toth). Sometimes both semantics and phonology are different (German Zeit ("time") is related to English "tide", but the English word, through a transitional phase of meaning "period"/"interval", has come primarily to mean gravitational effects on the ocean by the moon, though the original meaning is preserved in forms like tidings and betide, and phrases such as to tide over). 
 Words of Dutch and Low German origin).

===Other Germanic languages=== North Frisian Dutch vrijdom, Norwegian fridom, "freedom"). The Germanic languages Icelandic and Faroese also follow English in this respect, since, like English, they developed independent of German influences.

===French===
Many  " with the French librairie, which means bookstore; in French, the word for "library" is bibliothque. The pronunciation of most French loanwords in English (with the exception of a handful of more recently borrowed words such as mirage, genre, caf; or phrases like coup dtat, rendez-vous, etc.) has become largely anglicised and follows a typically English phonology and pattern of stress (compare English "nature" vs. French nature, "button" vs. bouton, "table" vs. table, "hour" vs. heure, "reside" vs. rsider, etc.).

===English as a global language===
 
Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been referred to as a "world language", the lingua franca of the modern era,  and while it is not an official language in most countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. It is, by international treaty, the official language for aeronautical  and maritime  communications. English is an official language of the United Nations and many other international organizations, including the International Olympic Committee.

English is the language most often studied as a foreign language in the European Union, by 89% of schoolchildren, ahead of French at 32%, while the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 68% in favour of English ahead of 25% for French.   by Eurobarometer, in   website  Among some non-English-speaking EU countries, a large percentage of the adult population claims to be able to converse in English&nbsp; in particular: 85% in Sweden, 83% in Denmark, 79% in the Netherlands, 66% in Luxembourg and over 50% in Finland, Slovenia, Austria, Belgium, and Germany.  In 2012, excluding native speakers, 38% of Europeans consider that they can speak English,  but only 3% of Japanese people. http://net-lang.net//externDisplayer/displayExtern/_path_/netlang_EN_pdfedition.pdf 

Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world, and English is the most commonly used language in the sciences  with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.

English literature predominates considerably with 28% of all volumes published in the world   and 30% of web content in 2011 (from 50% in 2000). 

The Wikipedia encyclopedia in English represents 44,4% of the global Wikipedia traffic (30% from native English-speaking countries and 14.4% from other countries). 
 regional varieties feed back into the language as a whole.   

==Dialects and varieties==
 
English has been subject to a large degree of regional dialect variation for many centuries. Its global spread now means that a large number of dialects and English-based creole languages and pidgins can be found all over the world.
 English of that of South Africa have to a lesser degree been influential native varieties of the language.
 varieties of English, which include, in most cases, several subvarieties, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie within British English; Newfoundland English within Canadian English; and African American Vernacular English ("Ebonics") and Southern American English within American English. English is a pluricentric language, without a central language authority like Frances Acadmie franaise; and therefore no one variety is considered "correct" or "incorrect" except in terms of the expectations of the particular audience to which the language is directed.
 Scots has its origins in early Northern Middle English  and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources. However, following the Acts of Union 1707 a process of language attrition began, whereby successive generations adopted more and more features from Standard English. Whether Scots is now a separate language or is better described as a dialect of English (i.e. part of Scottish English) is in dispute, although the UK government accepts Scots as a regional language and has recognised it as such under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.  There are a number of regional dialects of Scots, and pronunciation, grammar and lexis of the traditional forms differ, sometimes substantially, from other varieties of English.

English speakers have many different Accent (dialect)|accents, which often signal the speakers native dialect or language. For the most distinctive characteristics of regional accents, see Regional accents of English, and for a complete list of regional dialects, see List of dialects of the English language. Within England, variation is now largely confined to pronunciation rather than grammar or vocabulary. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to die out. 
 Jamaican Patois, Nigerian Pidgin, and Tok Pisin. There are many words in English coined to describe forms of particular non-English languages that contain a very high proportion of English words.

===Register effects=== speech registers tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon or Germanic origin, whereas the Latinate vocabulary is usually reserved for more formal uses such as legal, scientific, and otherwise scholarly or academic texts.

Child-directed speech, which is an informal speech register, also tends to rely heavily on vocabulary rife in words derived from Anglo-Saxon. The speech of mothers to young children has a higher percentage of native Anglo-Saxon verb tokens than speech addressed to adults.   In particular, in parents child-directed speech the clausal core    is built in the most part by Anglo-Saxon verbs, namely, almost all tokens of the grammatical relations subject-verb, verb-direct object and verb-indirect object that young children are presented with, are constructed with native verbs. Ninio, A. (2011). Syntactic development, its input and output. Oxford: Oxford University Press.  , ISBN 0199565961.  The Anglo-Saxon verb vocabulary consists of short verbs, but its grammar is relatively complex. Syntactic patterns specific to this sub-vocabulary in present-day English include periphrastic constructions for tense, aspect, questioning and negation, and phrasal lexemes functioning as complex predicates, all of which also occur in child-directed speech.

The historical origin of vocabulary items affects the order of acquisition of various aspects of language development in English-speaking children.  Latinate vocabulary is in general a later acquisition in children than the native Anglo-Saxon one.   Young children almost exclusively use the native verb vocabulary in constructing basic grammatical relations, apparently mastering its analytic aspects at an early stage. 

===Formal written English===
  South African, etc.).

===Simplified and constructed varieties===
Artificially simplified versions of the language have been created that are easier for non-native speakers to read.   , and seven weeks for Basic English.   Thus, Basic English may be employed by companies that need to make complex books for international use, as well as by language schools that need to impart some knowledge of English in a short time.

Ogden did not include any words in Basic English that could be said instead with a combination of other words already in the Basic English lexicon, and he worked to make the vocabulary suitable for speakers of any other language.  He put his vocabulary selections through a large number of tests and adjustments. Ogden also simplified the grammar but tried to keep it normal for English users. Although it was not built into a program, similar simplifications were devised for various international uses.
 controlled language originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals. It employs a carefully limited and standardised  subset of English. Simplified English has a lexicon of approved words and those words can only be used in certain ways. For example, the word close can be used in the phrase "Close the door" but not "do not go close to the landing gear".

Other constructed varieties of English include:
* E-Prime excludes forms of the verb to be. English reform is an attempt to improve collectively upon the English language.
* Manually Coded English consists of a variety of systems that have been developed to represent the English language with hand signals, designed primarily for use in deaf education. These should not be confused with true sign languages such as British Sign Language and American Sign Language used in Anglophone countries, which are independent and not based on English.
* Seaspeak and the related Airspeak and PoliceSpeak, all based on restricted vocabularies, were designed by Edward Johnson starting from the 1980s to aid international cooperation and communication in specific areas.
* Special English is a simplified version of English used by the Voice of America. It uses a vocabulary of only 1500 words.

Where consonants are given in pairs (as with "p b"), the first is voiceless consonant|voiceless, the second is voiced. Most of the symbols represent the same sounds as they normally do when used as letters (see   below), but   represents the initial sound of yacht. The symbol   represents the sh sound,   the middle sound of vision,   the ch sound,   the sound of j in jump,   and   the th sounds in thing and this respectively, and   the ng sound in sing. The voiceless velar fricative   is not a regular phoneme in most varieties of English, although it is used by some speakers in Scots/Gaelic words such as loch|loch or in other loanwords such as Chanuka|Chanukah.

Some of the more significant variations in the pronunciation of consonants are these: rhotic accents such as Received Pronunciation and Australian English,   can only appear before a vowel (so there is no "r" sound in words like card). The actual pronunciation of   varies between dialects; most common is the alveolar approximant  . flapped   in many positions between vowels.

Some points to note:
* For words which in RP have  , most North American dialects have   (as in the example of box above) or   (as in cloth). However some North American varieties do not have the vowel   at all (except before  ); see cotcaught merger|cotcaught merger.
* In present-day Received Pronunciation, the realization of the // phoneme is more open than the symbol suggests, and is closer to  , as in most other accents in Britain. The sound   is now found only in conservative RP. 
* In General American and some other rhotic accents, the combination of vowel+  is often realized as an r-colored vowel. For example, butter   is pronounced with an r-colored schwa,  . Similarly nurse contains the r-colored vowel  .
* The vowel conventionally written   is actually pronounced more centrally, as  , in RP. In the northern half of England this vowel is replaced by   (so cut rhymes with put). unstressed syllables there may or may not be a distinction between   (schwa) and   ( ). So for some speakers there is no difference between roses and Rosas. For more information see Reduced vowels in English.
* The diphthongs   and   ( ) tend towards the monophthongal pronunciations   and   in some dialects, including Canadian, Scottish, Irish and Northern English.
* In parts of North America   is pronounced   before voiceless consonants. This is particularly true in Canada, where also   is pronounced   in this position. See Canadian raising.
* The sound   is coming to be replaced by   in many words; for example, sure is often pronounced like shore. See English-language vowel changes before historic r.

===Stress, rhythm and intonation=== stressed language, in which stress is said to be phoneme|phonemic, i.e. capable of distinguishing words (such as the noun increase, stressed on the first syllable, and the verb increase, stressed on the second syllable; see also Initial-stress-derived noun). In almost any word of more than one syllable there will be one syllable identified as taking the primary stress, and possibly another taking a secondary stress, as in civilization  , in which the first syllable carries secondary stress, the fourth syllable carries primary stress, and the other syllables are unstressed. 

Closely related to stress in English is the process of vowel reduction; for example, in the noun contract the first syllable is stressed and contains the vowel   (in RP), whereas in the verb contract the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to   (schwa).  The same process applies to certain common function words like of, which are pronounced with different vowels depending on whether or not they are stressed within the sentence. For more details, see Reduced vowels in English.

English also has strong prosodic stress  the placing of additional emphasis within a sentence on the words to which a speaker wishes to draw attention, and corresponding weaker pronunciation of less important words. As regards rhythm, English is classed as a stress-timed language  one in which there is a tendency for the time intervals between stressed syllables to become equal, with corresponding faster pronunciation of groups of unstressed syllables.
 syntactically in English; for example, to convey surprise or irony, or to change a statement into a question. Most dialects of English use falling pitch for definite statements, and rising pitch to express uncertainty, as in questions (particularly yes-no questions). There is also a characteristic change of pitch on strongly stressed syllables, particularly on the "nuclear" (most strongly stressed) syllable in a sentence or intonation group.

==Grammar==
 
 adjectival agreement. Case marking strong (e.g. weak verbs (e.g. love/loved or kick/kicked) inherited from its Germanic origins has declined in importance in modern English, and the remnants of inflection (such as plural marking) have become more regular.
 modal verbs passive voice and progressive grammatical aspect|aspect.

==Vocabulary==
English vocabulary has changed considerably over the centuries. 
 Old English ic, (cf. German Ich, Gothic ik, Latin ego, Greek ego, Sanskrit aham), me (cf. German mich, mir, Gothic mik, ms, Latin m, Greek eme, Sanskrit mam), numbers (e.g. one, two, three, cf. Dutch een, twee, drie, Gothic ains, twai, threis (reis), Latin nus, duo, trs, Greek oinos "ace (on dice)", duo, treis), common family relationships such as mother, father, brother, sister etc. (cf. Dutch moeder, Greek meter, Latin mater, Sanskrit mat; mother), names of many animals (cf. German Maus, Dutch muis, Sanskrit mus, Greek mus, Latin ms; mouse), and many common verbs (cf. Old High German knjan, Old Norse kn, Greek gignmi, Latin gnoscere, Hittite kanes; to know).
 syncope in Middle English (e.g. OldEng hafod > ModEng head, OldEng swol > ModEng soul) and to the loss of final syllables due to stress (e.g. OldEng gamen > ModEng game, OldEng rende > ModEng errand), not because Germanic words are inherently shorter than Latinate words (the lengthier, higher-register words of Old English were largely forgotten following the subjugation of English after the Norman Conquest, and most of the Old English lexis devoted to literature, the arts, and sciences ceased to be productive when it fell into disuse. Only the shorter, more direct, words of Old English tended to pass into the Modern language.)
 obfuscate an issue. George Orwells essay "Politics and the English Language", considered an important scrutinisation of the English language, is critical of this, as well as other perceived misuses of the language.
 derived from Norman French (e.g., warranty) and Parisian French (guarantee), and even choices involving multiple Germanic and Latinate sources are possible: sickness (Old English), ill (Old Norse), infirmity (French), affliction (Latin). Such synonyms harbour a variety of different meanings and nuances. Yet the ability to choose between multiple synonyms is not a consequence of French and Latin influence, as this same richness existed in English prior to the extensive borrowing of French and Latin terms. Old English was extremely resourceful in its ability to express synonyms and shades of meaning on its own, in many respects rivaling or exceeding that of Modern English (synonyms numbering in the thirties for certain concepts were not uncommon).

Take for instance the various ways to express the word "astronomer" or "astrologer" in Old English: tunglere, tungolcrftiga, tungolwtega, tdymbwltend, tdscawere.  In Modern English, however, the roles of such synonyms have largely been replaced by equivalents taken from Latin, French, and Greek, as English has taken the position of a diminished reliance upon native elements and resources for the creation of new words and terminologies. Familiarity with the etymology of groups of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their  , Doublet (linguistics).

A commonly noted area where Germanic and French-derived words coexist is that of domestic or game animals and the meats produced from them. The nouns for meats are often different from, and unrelated to, those for the corresponding animals, the animal commonly having a Germanic name and the meat having a French-derived one. Examples include: deer and venison; cow and beef; swine/pig and pork; and sheep/lamb and lamb and mutton|mutton. This is assumed to be a result of the aftermath of the Norman conquest of England, where an Anglo-Norman-speaking elite were the consumers of the meat, produced by lower classes, which happened to be largely Anglo-Saxon, although a similar duality can also be seen in other languages like French, which did not undergo such linguistic upheaval (e.g. boeuf "beef" vs. vache "cow"). With the exception of beef and pork, the distinction today is gradually becoming less and less pronounced (venison is commonly referred to simply as deer meat, mutton is lamb, and chicken is both the animal and the meat over the more traditional term poultry. Use of the term mutton, however,  remains, especially when referring to the meat of an older sheep, distinct from lamb; and poultry remains when referring to the meat of birds and fowls in general.)

There are Latinate words that are used in everyday speech. These words no longer appear Latinate and oftentimes have no Germanic equivalents. For instance, the words mountain, valley, river, aunt, uncle, move, use, and push are Latinate. Likewise, the inverse can occur: acknowledge, meaningful, understanding, mindful, lavish, behaviour, forbearance, behoove, forestall, allay, rhyme, starvation, embodiment come from Anglo-Saxon, and allegiance, abandonment, debu
