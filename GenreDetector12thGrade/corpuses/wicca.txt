==Terminology==
 
 masculine term for sorcerers, the actual individual who coined the capitalised term "Wicca" is unknown, though it has been speculated that it was Charles Cardell, who certainly used the term "Wiccen" during the 1950s.

Application of the word Wicca has given rise to "a great deal of disagreement and infighting".  Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca are often collectively termed British Traditional Wicca, and many of their practitioners consider the term Wicca to apply only to these lineaged traditions. Others do not use the word "Wicca" at all, instead preferring to be referred to only as "Witchcraft," while others believe that all modern witchcraft traditions can be considered "Wiccan." 
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer tends to use the terms Wiccan and "Wicca" as completely synonymous with the terms Witch and Witchcraft respectively. 

==Beliefs==
Beliefs vary markedly between different traditions and individual practitioners. However, various commonalities exist between these disparate groups, which usually include views on theology, the afterlife, magic and morality.

===Theology===
 
 .]]
 religious canon, Triple Goddess" duotheism (as atheists or agnosticism|agnostics, not believing in any actual deity, but instead viewing the gods as psychological archetypes of the human mind which can be evoked and interacted with. 
 Janet and animistic view of theology, Wiccans "regard the whole cosmos as alive, both as a whole and in all of its parts", but that "such an organic view of the cosmos cannot be fully expressed, and lived, without the concept of the God and Goddess. There is no manifestation without polarisation; so at the highest creative level, that of Divinity, the polarisation must be the clearest and most powerful of all, reflecting and spreading itself through all the microcosmic levels as well". 

===Duotheism=== gender Binary polarity and Moon Goddess and a Horned God. (This core theology was originally described by Gerald Gardner, the founder of the religion; and Doreen Valiente, who wrote much of the original liturgical materials.) The Goddess and the God may be regarded as the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine. They are complementary opposites or dualities, bearing similarities to the concept of yin and yang in Taoism. The God and Goddess are generally seen as lovers and equals, the Divine Couple who together co-create the cosmos.

====The God and the Goddess==== Mother Earth), but also sometimes as the Moon, which complements the God being viewed as the Sun. 

  }}

Traditionally the God is viewed as a Horned God, associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting and the life cycle.  The Horned God is given various names according to the tradition, and these include Cernunnos, Pan (god)|Pan, Atho and Karnayna.
 Sun God, Leader of the Wild Hunt and the Lord of Death.   
 Triple Goddess, Moon Goddess, Diana after monotheistic form of the Craft, Dianic Wicca, the Goddess is the sole deity, a concept that has been criticised by members of other more egalitarian traditions.
 Prime Mover", although the witches did not concern themselves much with this being. 
 early modern witch trials in Europe, that those two deities, though primarily the Horned God, had been worshipped by a Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult ever since western Europe had succumbed to Christianity. Whilst now widely discredited, Gerald Gardner was a supporter of her theory, and believed that Wicca was a continuation of that historical Witch-Cult, and that the Horned God and Goddess were therefore ancient deities of the British Isles.  Modern scholarship has disproved his claims, however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early medieval periods. 

====Pantheism, Polytheism and Animism====

 pantheistic deity, Prime Mover, The One.  Other Wiccans such as Starhawk use the term Star Goddess to describe the universal pantheistic deity that created the cosmos, and regard her as a knowable deity that can and should be worshipped.  
 polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right. The Wiccan writers Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview.  Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms, thereby technically allowing them to be atheism|atheists.  Such a view was purported by the High Priestess Vivianne Crowley, herself a psychology|psychologist, who considered the Wiccan deities to be Jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual. It was for this reason that she said that "The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision."   
 immanent religion, Drawing down the Moon or Drawing down the Sun.

===Afterlife===
Belief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans,  although reincarnation is a traditional Wiccan teaching dating back to the New Forest coven in the 1930s. The influential High Priest Raymond Buckland said that a humans soul reincarnates into the same species over many lives in order to learn lessons and advance spiritually,  but this belief is not universal, as many Wiccans believe in the reincarnation of the soul through different species. However, a popular saying amongst Wiccans is that "once a witch, always a witch", indicating a belief that Wiccans are the reincarnations of previous witches.   
 spirit mediums Alexandrian High Alex Sanders, who stated that "they are dead; leave them in peace."  This belief was likely influenced by Spiritualism, which was very popular at the time of Wiccas emergence, and with which Gardner and other early Wiccans such as Buckland and Sanders had some experience. 

Despite some belief therein, Wicca does not place an emphasis on the afterlife, focusing instead on the current one; as the historian Ronald Hutton remarked, "the instinctual position of most  , therefore, seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present". 

===Magic=== MacGregor Mathers stated that it was "the science of the control of the secret forces of nature".  Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science,  and as such they do not view it as being supernatural, but being a part of the "super powers that reside in the natural" according to Leo Martello.  Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses that achieve surprising results,  whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so. 

 
 spells or Alex Sanders, white magic", which contrasted with "black magic", which they associated with evil and Satanism. Sanders also used the similar terminology of "left hand path" to describe malevolent magic, and "right hand path" to describe magic performed with good intentions;  terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil. 
 William Bainbridge, claimed, in 1985, that Wicca had "reacted to secularisation by a headlong plunge back into magic" and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out. This view was heavily criticised in 1999 by the historian Ronald Hutton, who claimed that the evidence displayed the very opposite, that "a large number   were in jobs at the cutting edge  , such as computer technology." 

===Morality===

There exists no   which holds that whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return to that person with triple force, or with equal force on each of the three levels of body, mind and spirit, Lembke, Karl (2002)  .  similar to the eastern idea of karma. The Wiccan Rede was introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente, one of his High Priestesses.  The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by Monique Wilson   and further popularised by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca.

Although Gerald Gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to Homosexuality and Wicca|homosexuality, claiming that it brought down "the curse of the goddess",  it is now generally accepted in all traditions of Wicca, with certain groups like the Minoan Brotherhood openly crafting their philosophy around it,  and various important figures in the Craft, such as Alex Sanders and Eddie Buczynski, being openly homosexual or bisexual.

===Five elements===
  phases of water and aether (or spirit), which unites the other four.    Various analogies have been devised to explain the concept of the five elements; for instance, the Wiccan Ann-Marie Gallagher used that of a tree, which is composed of earth (with the soil and plant matter), water (sap and moisture), fire (through photosynthesis) and air (the creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide), all of which are believed to be united through spirit. 

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote="Darksome Night and Shining Moon, 
East and South and West and North, 
Hearken to the Witches Rune; 
Hear me now, I call thee forth."|source=Doreen Valiente
 }}
 Frederic Lamond, Robert Cochranes Clan of Tubal Cain associated earth with south, fire with east, water with west and air with north,  and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary Horned God and Goddess. The five elements are symbolised by the five points of the pentagram, the most prominently used symbol of Wicca.   

===Natural cycles=== Goddess is God is mainly associated with the Sun.

==Practices==
The Neopagan researcher and High Priestess Margot Adler, who defined ritual as being "one method of reintegrating individuals and groups into the cosmos, and to tie in the activities of daily life with their ever present, often forgotten, significance" noted that rituals, celebrations and rites of passage in Wicca are not "dry, formalised, repetitive experiences", but are performed with the purpose of inducing a religious experience in the participants, thereby altering their consciousness.  She noted that many Wiccans remain sceptical about the existence of the gods, afterlife etc but remain involved in the Craft because of its ritual experiences, with one, Glenna Turner, saying that "I love myth, dream, visionary art. The Craft is a place where all of these things fit together - beauty, pageantry, music, dance, song, dream." 
 fundamentalist looks Genesis really seems crazy. Its an alien head-space."  Similarly, Adler stated that "ironically, considering the many pronouncements against Witchcraft as a threat to reason, the Craft is one of the few religious viewpoints totally compatible with modern science, allowing total scepticism about even its own methods, myths and rituals". 

===Ritual practices===

 magical tools. These usually include a knife called an athame, a wand, a pentacle and a chalice, but other tools include a broomstick known as a Besom broom#In Wicca|besom, a cauldron, candles, incense and a curved blade known as a boline. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the God and the Goddess may be displayed.  Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.
 Charles Lelands supposed record of Italian witchcraft.  Other traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes. In certain traditions, ritualised sex magic is performed in the form of the Great Rite, whereby a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess to possess them before performing sexual intercourse to raise magical energy for use in spellwork. In nearly all cases it is instead performed "in token", thereby merely symbolically, using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb. 

One of Wiccas best known liturgical texts is "The Charge of the Goddess".  The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of Doreen Valiente,  who developed it from Gardners version. Gardners wording of the original "Charge" added extracts from the works of Aleister Crowleys work, including The Book of the Law, (especially from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess) thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the revelations of Thelema. Valiente rewrote Gardners version in verse, keeping the material derived from Aradia, but removing the material from Crowley.

===Rites of passage===
  Gerald Gardner, and from him is said to go back to the New Forest coven; however, the existence of this coven remains unproven.  Gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of "a year and a day" between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated, although he frequently broke this rule with initiates.
 the ritual tools and implements. It is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name. By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens. The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves the participation of the Great Rite, either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual flagellation. which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones. By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.  
 James R. Lewis, in his book Witchcraft today: an encyclopaedia of Wiccan and neopagan traditions, a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third-degree high priestess (in the orthodox Gardnerian system). She then becomes eligible to wear the "moon crown". The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage, and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of "lineage papers" proving the authenticity of her status. 
  in England, which occurred during Beltane in 2005.]]
 Cochranian tradition, Robert Cochrane, does not have the three degrees of initiation, merely having the stages of novice and initiate.

Some solitary Wiccans also perform self-initiation rituals, to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan. The first of these to be published was in Paul Husons Mastering Witchcraft (1970), and unusually involved recitation of the Lords Prayer backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical Witch Hunt.  Subsequent, more overtly pagan self-initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like Doreen Valiente, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf.

Infants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a Wiccaning, which is analogous to a Infant baptism|Christening. The purpose of this is to present the infant to the God and Goddess for protection. Despite this, in accordance with the importance put on free will in Wicca, the child is not necessarily expected or required to adhere to Wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they get older. 

===Book of Shadows===
  occultist Aleister Crowley, whom Gardner knew personally. Also in the Book are examples of poetry largely composed by Gardner and his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, the most notable of which is the Charge of the Goddess.

 
 ceremonial magicians,    the Book contained instructions for how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like Eko Eko Azarak to use in those rituals. Gardners original intention was that every copy of the Book would be different, because a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered. The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non-initiates into BTW, but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar.    

Today, adherents of many non-BTW traditions have also adopted the concept of the Book of Shadows, with many solitaries also keeping their own versions, sometimes including material taken from the published Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In other traditions however, practices are never written down, meaning that there is no need for a Book of Shadows.

==Traditions==
 
In the 1950s through to the 1970s, when the Wiccan movement was largely confined to lineaged groups such as Gardnerian Wicca, a "tradition" usually implied the transfer of a lineage by initiation. However, with the rise of more and more such groups, often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage, the term came to be a synonym for a religious denomination within Wicca. There are many such traditions       and there are also many solitary practitioners who do not align themselves with any particular lineage, working alone. There are also covens that have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition, instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically.
 Robert Cochrane; Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen; and Dianic Wicca, whose followers often trace their influences back to Zsuzsanna Budapest. Some of these groups prefer to refer to themselves as Witches, thereby distinguishing themselves from the BTW traditions, who more typically use the term Wiccan (see Wicca#Etymology|Etymology).

Many traditions, including those of British Traditional Wicca, require formal initiation within an established coven for membership of their respective traditions. In this manner, all BTWs can trace a direct line of descent all the way back to Gardner. Other traditions, however, do not hold this to be necessary.

===Covens===
Lineaged Wicca is organised into covens of initiated priests and priestesses. Covens are autonomous, and are generally headed by a High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership, being a couple who have each been through their first, second and third degrees of initiation. Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven. Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment, but this is not a necessity, and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven. 

A commonly quoted Wiccan tradition holds that the ideal number of members for a coven is 13 (number)|thirteen, though this is not held as a hard-and-fast rule.  Indeed, many U.S. covens are far smaller, though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated Wiccans at "open" rituals. When covens grow beyond their ideal number of members, they often split (or "hive") into multiple covens, yet remain connected as a group. A grouping of multiple covens is known as a grove in many traditions. 

Initiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day.  
A course of study may be set during this period. In some covens a "dedication" ceremony may be performed during this period, some time before the initiation proper, allowing the person to attend certain rituals on a probationary basis. Some solitary Wiccans also choose to study for a year and a day before their self-dedication to the religion.

It was during the 1930s that the first evidence appears for the practice of a pagan Witchcraft religion   See also  ,  Cheshire  and the New Forest had set themselves up as continuing in the tradition of Murrays Witch-Cult, albeit with influences coming from disparate sources such as ceremonial magic, folk magic, Freemasonry, Theosophy, Romanticism, Neo-Druidism|Druidry, classical mythology and Asian religions.
