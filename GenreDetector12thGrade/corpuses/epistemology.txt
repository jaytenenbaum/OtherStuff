 analyzing the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as truth, belief, and Theory of justification|justification.

The term "epistemology" was introduced by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier (1808–1864). 

==Knowledge==
 

===Knowledge that, knowledge how, and knowledge by acquaintance=== knowledge how" and "acquaintance-knowledge."  For example: in mathematics, it is known that 2 + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to add two numbers and knowing a person (e.g., oneself), place (e.g., ones hometown), thing (e.g., cars), or activity (e.g., addition). Some philosophers think there is an important distinction between "knowing that," "knowing how," and "acquaintance-knowledge," with epistemology being primarily concerned with the first of these. 
 balance cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryles, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between knowledge that and knowledge how leads to infinite regress.

In recent times, some epistemologists (Ernest Sosa|Sosa, John Greco (philosopher)|Greco, Jonathan Kvanvig|Kvanvig, Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Zagzebski) and Duncan Pritchard have argued that epistemology should evaluate peoples "properties" (i.e., intellectual virtues) and not just the properties of propositions or of propositional mental attitudes. 

===Belief===
 
In common speech, a "statement of belief" is typically an expression of faith and/or trust in a person, power or other entity — a paradigmatic example of such a statement of belief would be a declaration or affirmation of religious faith (as in, e.g., the Nicene Creed).  While it addresses belief of this kind epistemology is also concerned with belief in a very much broader sense of the word. In this broader sense "belief" simply means the acceptance as true of any cognitive content.  To believe is to accept as true.  

===Truth===
 
Whether someones belief is true is not a prerequisite for (its) belief.  On the other hand, if something is actually known, then it categorically cannot be false.  For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support him, and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under his weight, it could be said that he believed that the bridge was safe but that his belief was mistaken. It would not be accurate to say that he knew that the bridge was safe, because plainly it was not. By contrast, if the bridge actually supported his weight, then he might say that he had believed that the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to himself (by crossing it), he knows that it is safe. 

Epistemologists argue over whether belief is the proper truth-bearer.  Some would rather describe knowledge as a system of justified true propositions, and others as a system of justified true sentences.  Plato, in his Gorgias, argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer. 
 

===Justification===
In many of Platos dialogues, such as the Meno, and in particular the Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus, Socrates considers a number of theories as to what knowledge is, the last being that knowledge is true belief that has been "given an account of"&nbsp;— meaning explained or defined in some way. According to the theory that knowledge is justified true belief, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. One implication of this would be that no one would gain knowledge just by believing something that happened to be true. For example, an ill person with no medical training, but with a generally optimistic attitude, might believe that he will recover from his illness quickly. Nevertheless, even if this belief turned out to be true, the patient would not have known that he would get well since his belief lacked justification. theories of justification  for other views on the idea.

===The Gettier problem===

Edmund Gettier is remembered for his 1963 argument, which called into question the theory of knowledge that had been dominant among philosophers for thousands of years.

}}   In a few pages, Gettier argued that there are situations in which ones belief may be justified and true, yet fail to count as knowledge.  That is, Gettier contended that while justified belief in a true proposition is necessary for that proposition to be known, it is not sufficient.  As in the diagram, a true proposition can be believed by an individual (purple region) but still not fall within the "knowledge" category (yellow region).

According to Gettier, there are certain circumstances in which one does not have knowledge, even when all of the above conditions are met.  Gettier proposed two thought experiments, which have come to be known as "Gettier cases," as counterexamples to the classical account of knowledge.  One of the cases involves two men, Smith and Jones, who are awaiting the results of their applications for the same job.  Each man has ten coins in his pocket.  Smith has excellent reasons to believe that Jones will get the job and, furthermore, knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket (he recently counted them).  From this Smith infers, "the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket."  However, Smith is unaware that he also has ten coins in his own pocket.  Furthermore, Smith, not Jones, is going to get the job.  While Smith has strong evidence to believe that Jones will get the job, he is wrong.  Smith has a justified true belief that a man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job; however, according to Gettier, Smith does not know that a man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job, because Smiths belief is "...true by virtue of the number of coins in Joness pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smiths pocket, and bases his belief...on a count of the coins in Joness pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job." (see  p.&nbsp;122.) These cases fail to be knowledge because the subjects belief is justified, but only happens to be true by virtue of luck. In other words, he made the correct choice (in this case predicting an outcome) for the wrong reasons. This example is similar to those often given when discussing belief and truth, wherein a persons belief of what will happen can coincidentally be correct without his or her having the actual knowledge to base it on.

====Responses to Gettier====
The responses to Gettier have been varied. Usually, they have involved substantive attempts to provide a definition of knowledge different from the classical one, either by recasting knowledge as justified true belief with some additional fourth condition, or as something else altogether.

=====Infallibilism, indefeasibility===== infallibilist one.  To qualify as an item of knowledge, goes the theory, a belief must not only be true and justified, the justification of the belief must necessitate its truth. In other words, the justification for the belief must be infallible.

Yet another possible candidate for the fourth condition of knowledge is indefeasibility.  Defeasibility theory maintains that there should be no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify ones belief. For example, suppose that person S believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to justify the claim that Tom Grabit stole a book from the library.  A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, "Tom Grabits identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom."  When no defeaters of ones justification exist, a subject would be epistemically justified.

The Indian philosopher B K Matilal has drawn on the Navya-Nyaya fallibilism tradition to respond to the Gettier problem.
Nyaya theory distinguishes between know p and know that one knows p – these are different events, with different causal conditions.
The second level is a sort of implicit inference that usually follows immediately the episode of knowing p (knowledge simpliciter).  The Gettier
case is analyzed by referring to a view of Gangesha (late 12th century), who takes any true belief to be knowledge; thus a true belief acquired through a wrong route may just be regarded as knowledge simpliciter on this view.
The question of justification arises only at the second level, when one
considers the knowledgehood of the acquired belief.
Initially, there is lack of uncertainty, so it becomes a true belief.
But at the very next moment, when the hearer is about to embark upon the venture of knowing whether he knows p, doubts may arise.  "If, in
some Gettier-like cases, I am wrong in my inference about the
knowledgehood of the given occurrent belief (for the evidence may be
pseudo-evidence), then I am mistaken about the truth of my belief – and
this is in accordance with Nyaya fallibilism: not all knowledge-claims can be
sustained."

Knowing that one knows.  It is also discussed in Matilals Word and the World p. 71-72. 

=====Reliabilism=====
 

Reliabilism has been the main line of response to the Gettier challenge among philosophers, originating with work by Alvin Goldman in the 1960s.  According to reliabilism, a belief is justified (or otherwise supported in such a way as to count towards knowledge) only if it is produced by processes that typically yield a sufficiently high ratio of true to false beliefs. In other words, this theory states that a true belief counts as knowledge only if it is produced by a reliable belief-forming process.

Reliabilism has been challenged by Gettier cases. Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), is the case of Henry and the barn façades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees a number of buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that he has just seen barns. While he has seen one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other barn-like buildings he saw were façades. Theoretically, Henry doesnt know that he has seen a barn, despite both his belief that he has seen one being true and his belief being formed on the basis of a reliable process (i.e. his vision), since he only acquired his true belief by accident. 

=====Other responses=====
Robert Nozick has offered the following definition of knowledge:

S knows that P if and only if:
* P;
* S believes that P;
* if P were false, S would not believe that P;
* if P is true, S will believe that P.

Nozick argues that the third of these conditions serves to address cases of the sort described by Gettier. Nozick further claims this condition addresses a case of the sort described by D. M. Armstrong:

  A father believes his daughter innocent of committing a particular crime, both because of faith in his baby girl and (now) because he has seen presented in the courtroom a conclusive demonstration of his daughters innocence. His belief via the method of the courtroom satisfies the four subjunctive conditions, but his faith-based belief does not. If his daughter were guilty, he would still believe her innocent, on the basis of faith in his daughter; this would violate the third condition.

The British philosopher Simon Blackburn has criticized this formulation by suggesting that we do not want to accept as knowledge beliefs, which, while they "track the truth" (as Nozicks account requires), are not held for appropriate reasons.  He says that "we do not want to award the title of knowing something to someone who is only meeting the conditions through a defect, flaw, or failure, compared with someone else who is not meeting the conditions.".  In addition to this, externalist accounts of knowledge, such as Nozicks, are often forced to reject closure in cases where it is intuitively valid.

Timothy Williamson has advanced a theory of knowledge according to which knowledge is not justified true belief plus some extra condition(s). In his book Knowledge and its Limits, Williamson argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be analyzed into a set of other concepts—instead, it is sui generis. Thus, though knowledge requires justification, truth, and belief, the word "knowledge" cant be, according to Williamsons theory, accurately regarded as simply shorthand for "justified true belief."
 Causal Theory of Knowing that in order for knowledge to truly exist there must be a causal chain between the proposition and the belief of that proposition.

===Externalism and internalism===
 
Part of the debate over the nature of knowledge is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand, and epistemological internalists on the other.
Externalists think that factors deemed "external", meaning outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge, can be conditions of knowledge. For example, an externalist response to the Gettier problem is to say that, in order for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, it must be caused, in the right sort of way, by relevant facts. Such causation, to the extent that it is "outside" the mind, would count as an external, knowledge-yielding condition. Internalists, contrariwise, claim that all knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge.

While unfamiliar with the internalist/externalist debate himself, many point to René Descartes as an early example of the internalist approach to justification. He wrote that, because the only method by which we perceive the external world is through our senses, and that, because the senses are not infallible, we should not consider our concept of knowledge to be infallible. The only way to find anything that could be described as "indubitably true," he advocates, would be to see things "clearly and distinctly".    He argued that if there is an omnipotent, good being who made the world, then its reasonable to believe that people are made with the ability to know. However, this does not mean that mans ability to know is perfect. God gave man the ability to know, but not omniscience. Descartes said that man must use his capacities for knowledge correctly and carefully through methodological doubt.     The dictum "Cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am) is also commonly associated with Descartes theory, because in his own methodological doubt, doubting everything he previously knew in order to start from a blank slate, the first thing that he could not logically bring himself to doubt was his own existence: "I do not exist" would be a contradiction in terms; the act of saying that one does not exist assumes that someone must be making the statement in the first place. Though Descartes could doubt his senses, his body and the world around him, he could not deny his own existence, because he was able to doubt and must exist in order to do so. Even if some "evil genius" were to be deceiving him, he would have to exist in order to be deceived. This one sure point provided him with what he would call his Archimedean point, in order to further develop his foundation for knowledge. Simply put, Descartes epistemological justification depended upon his indubitable belief in his own existence and his clear and distinct knowledge of God.   

===The Value problem===
A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in Platos Meno. The problem is to identify what is it about knowledge (if anything) that makes it more valuable than mere true belief. The value problem re-emerged in the philosophical literature on epistemology in recent years. One of the more influential responses to the problem is that knowledge is not particularly valuable and is not what ought to be the main focus of epistemology. Instead, epistemologists ought to focus on other mental states, such as understanding. 

==Acquiring knowledge==
The second question that will be dealt with is the question of how knowledge is acquired. This area of epistemology covers:
# Issues concerning epistemic distinctions such as that between empirical and non-empirical methods of formulating knowledge.
# Distinguish between synthesis and analysis used as means of proof
# Debates such as the one between empiricists and rationalists.
# What is called "the regress problem"

===A priori and a posteriori knowledge===
 
The nature of this distinction has been disputed by various philosophers; however, the terms may be roughly defined as follows: A priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at beforehand, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything that is independent from experience. A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).

Evolutionary psychology takes a novel approach to the problem. It says that there is an innate predisposition for certain types of learning. "Only small parts of the brain resemble a tabula rasa; this is true even for human beings. The remainder is more like an exposed negative waiting to be dipped into a developer fluid" 

===Analytic–synthetic distinction===
 
 Kant stated necessarily true but our knowledge about the attributes of the mathematical or physical subjects we can only get by logical inference.

The American philosopher W. V. O. Quine, in his "Two Dogmas of Empiricism", famously challenged the distinction, arguing that the two have a blurry boundary. Some contemporary philosophers have offered more sustainable accounts of the distinction. 

===Branches or tendencies within epistemology===
====Empiricism====
  perceptual observations by the senses.  Certain forms treat all knowledge as empirical,  while some regard disciplines such as mathematics and logic as exceptions. 
 realism being among the most commonly expounded but central to all empiricist epistemologies is the notion of the epistemologically privileged status of sense data.

====Idealism====
 
Many idealists believe that knowledge is primarily (at least in some areas) acquired by a priori processes or is innatism|innate—for example, in the form of concepts not derived from experience. The relevant theoretical processes often go by the name "intuition (philosophy)|intuition".

  The relevant theoretical concepts may purportedly be part of the structure of the human mind (as in Kants theory of transcendental idealism), or they may be said to exist independently of the mind (as in Platos theory of Forms).

====Rationalism====
 
By contrast with empiricism and idealism, which emphasize the epistemologically privileged status of sense data (empirical) and the primacy of Reason (theoretical) respectively, modern rationalism adds a third system of thinking, (as Gaston Bachelard has termed these areas) and holds that all three are of equal importance: The empirical, the theoretical and the abstract. For Bachelard, rationalism makes equal reference to all three systems of thinking.

An example of abstract thinking is Pythagoras concept of pure geometric forms: perfect triangles, squares, circles, etc. Another example is imaginary numbers, in mathematics.

====Constructivism====
  Vico said: "The norm of the truth is to have made it."

===The regress problem===
 
"... to justify a belief one must appeal to a further justified belief. This means that one of two things can be the case. Either there are some   beliefs that we can be justified for holding, without being able to justify them on the basis of any other belief, or else for each justified belief there is an infinite regress of (potential) justification  . On this theory there is no rock bottom of justification. Justification just meanders in and out through our network of beliefs, stopping nowhere."

}} p. 26.  The apparent impossibility of completing an infinite chain of reasoning is thought by some to support skepticism. Socrates said, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."

====Response to the regress problem====
Many epistemologists studying justification have attempted to argue for various types of chains of reasoning that can escape the regress problem.

=====Infinitism=====
It is not impossible for an infinite justificatory series to exist. This position is known as "infinitism". Infinitists typically take the infinite series to be merely potential, in the sense that an individual may have indefinitely many reasons available to him, without having consciously thought through all of these reasons when the need arises. This position is motivated in part by the desire to avoid what is seen as the arbitrariness and circularity of its chief competitors, foundationalism and coherentism. In mathematics, an infinite series will sometimes converge – (this is the basis of calculus) – one can therefore have an infinite series of logical arguments and analyze it for a convergent (or non-convergent) solution.

=====Foundationalism===== Foundationalists respond to the regress problem by claiming that "foundations" or "basic beliefs" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from other beliefs. These beliefs might be justified because they are self-evident, infallible, or derive from reliable cognitive mechanisms. Perception, memory, and a priori intuition are often considered to be possible examples of basic beliefs.

The chief criticism of foundationalism is that if a belief is not supported by other beliefs, accepting it may be arbitrary or unjustified. 

=====Coherentism===== coherentists hold corresponds to reality. Additionally, most logicians agree that any argument that is circular is inherently invalid. That is, arguments must be linear with conclusions that flow directly from stated premises.

However, Warburton writes in Thinking from A to Z, "Circular arguments are not invalid; in other words, from a logical point of view there is nothing intrinsically wrong with them. However, they are, when viciously circular, spectacularly uninformative.(Warburton 1996)."

=====Foundherentism=====
A position known as "foundherentism", advanced by Susan Haack, is meant to be a unification of foundationalism and coherentism. One component of this theory is what is called the "analogy of the crossword puzzle." Whereas, for example, infinitists regard the regress of reasons as "shaped" like a single line, Susan Haack has argued that it is more like a crossword puzzle, with multiple lines mutually supporting each other. 

==What do people know?==
The last question that will be dealt with
