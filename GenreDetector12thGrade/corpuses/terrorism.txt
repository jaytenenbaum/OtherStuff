  unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. The writer Heinrich Bll and scholars Raj Desai and Harry Eckstein have suggested that attempts to protect against terrorism may lead to a kind of social oppression.  

The word "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged, Hoffman, Bruce. Inside Terrorism, Columbia University Press, 1998 ISBN 0-231-11468-0. P. 32. See review in the New York Times  .  and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of terrorism.   The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents,  and potentially legitimize the states own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as "terror" by opponents of the state).  {{cite news

An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

In November 2004, a United Nations Secretary General report described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act".  

==Definition==
 
  with "Stop Terrorism!" description]] definitions of terrorism in their national legislation. Moreover, the international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged. Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in The New York Times  .  In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian Parliament, stated that 
 "The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination."  
 Comprehensive Convention sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. 

Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: 
 "Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them."  

Bruce Hoffman, a scholar, has noted:

 It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, Political Terrorism: A Research Guide, Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in an effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the search for an adequate definition is still on Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt.  

Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that: car bombing in August 2005 that killed 43 people.]] By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is : motives
* violent  or, equally important, threatens violence
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or Non-state actor|non-state entity. }}

A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

Very often, the victims of terrorism are targeted not because they are threats, but because they are specific "symbols, tools, animals or corrupt beings"  that tie into a specific view of the world that the terrorists possess. Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists goals of instilling fear, getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas.

Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act.   to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus "lawful") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups. Using this criterion, actions that would otherwise qualify as terrorism would not be considered terrorism if they were government sanctioned.  For example, firebombing a city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government.  This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted,  because: it denies the existence of state terrorism; {{cite news

On the question of whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing civilians, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin,   argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when "a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so".  {{cite news

In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted: On one Brian Jenkins has written, thus seems to depend on ones point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint. Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism. {{cite news

The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the   Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, Printed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, January 2003.  Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawas Carleton University, defines "terrorist acts" as attacks against civilians for political or other ideological goals, and said:
 

Some groups, when involved in a "liberation" struggle, have been called "terrorists" by the Western governments or media. Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called "statesmen" by similar organizations. Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela.       WikiLeaks whistleblower Julian Assange has been called a "terrorist" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.  
 Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States closest allies (the United Kingdom) which the UK branded as terrorism. This was highlighted by the Quinn v. Robinson case.

One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was entitled Disorders and Terrorism, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H.H.A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff. 
The Task Force classified terrorism into six categories. 
* Civil disorder  A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community. Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes. political purposes coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective.
* Quasi-terrorism  The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction. {{cite news

The relationship between domestic terrorism and democracy is very complex. Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and is least common in the most democratic nations.

While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties. {{cite news
