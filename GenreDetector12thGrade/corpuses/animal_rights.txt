Animal rights is the idea that some or all nonhuman animals are entitled to the possession of their own lives, and that their most basic interests  such as an interest in not suffering  should be afforded the same consideration as the similar interests of human beings.  Advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone  an idea known since 1970 as speciesism, when the term was coined by Richard D. Ryder  arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.  They agree for the most part that animals should no longer be viewed as property, or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden. That a central goal of animal rights is to eliminate the property status of animals, see Sunstein (2004), p. 11ff.

 abolitionist view deontologist argues that at least some animals are "subjects-of-a-life," with beliefs, desires, memories, and a sense of their own future, who must be treated as ends in themselves, not as a means to an end. Singer (1975); Regan (1983), p. 243. Protectionists seek utilitarian is equal consideration. animal liberation. Multiple cultural traditions around the world, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, also support some forms of animal rights. In Islam, animal rights were recognized early by Sharia (Islamic law). Scientific studies have also provided evidence of similar evolutionary characteristics and cognitive abilities between humans and some animals .

Critics of animals rights argue that animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.  A parallel argument, known as the animal welfare position, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and insofar as they have interests, those interests may be overridden, though what counts as necessary suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably. Garner (2005), pp. 11, 16. fur farms animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have also attracted criticism, including from within the animal rights movement itself,  as well as prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of the "Animal Enterprise Protection Act (amended in 2006 by the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act)".

==Historical development in the West==
===Moral status of animals in the ancient world===
 
  argued that animals lacked reason (logos), and place humans at the top of the natural world. ]] Adam is given "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted over the centuries to imply ownership.  Animal were things to be possessed and used, whereas man was created in the image of God, and was superior to everything else in nature. 

The philosopher and mathematician,   (c. 371  c. 287 BCE) argued that animals had reason too; he opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust. Taylor (2009), p. 37.   Theophrastus did not prevail; Richard Sorabji writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve.

====Early animal protection laws in the English-speaking world====
 According to   (1989) writes that, at the height of Ren Descartes influence in Europeand his view that animals were simply automatait is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines. Nash (1989), p. 19.

====Ren Descartes====
 s ideas about animals remained influential into the 20th century. ]]
  mechanistic theory of the universe, the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience. Cottingham (1995), pp. 188192.  Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses.
There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanism (philosophy)#Universal mechanism|mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel?  Voltaire (16941778) }} separate substance, linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex Automaton|automata, with no souls, minds, or reason. They could see, hear, and touch, but were not conscious, able to suffer, and had no language. Midgley, Mary (May 24, 1999).  , The New Statesman. 

===Treatment of animals as mans duty towards himself===
====John Locke, Immanuel Kant====
Against Descartes, the British philosopher John Locke (16321704) argued, in Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), that animals did have feelings, and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong, but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animals owner, or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel. Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals, he wrote: "For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even towards men." 

Lockes position echoed that of   asks: "Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake." Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals, but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty. 

The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (17241804), following Aquinas, opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans. For Kant, cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind. He argued in 1785 that "cruelty to animals is contrary to mans duty to himself, because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other human beings is weakened." Kant (1785), part II, paras 16 and 17. 

===18th century: Centrality of sentience===

====Jean-Jacques Rousseau====
  (1762), he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet.

====Jeremy Bentham====
 : "The time will come, when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes." ]]
Four years later, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher  :
 villosity of os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Bentham (1789), quoted in Garner (2005), pp. 1213.  

===19th century: Emergence of jus animalium===
 
 , one of the rural sports campaigners sought to ban from 1800 onwards]]
The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection, particularly in England. Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old, the needy, children, and the insane, and that this concern was extended to nonhumans. Before the 19th century, there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals, but only because of the damage to the animal as property. In 1793, for example, John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animals tongue out; the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner. Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 40. 
 William Pulteney Lord Erskine (c. 17461828) introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding, wanton cruelty, and beating. He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property: "They have no rights.   that defect in the law which I seek to remedy." The Bill was passed by the Lords, but was opposed in the Commons by Windham, who said it would be used against the "lower orders" when the real culprits would be their employers. Phelps (2007), pp. 9698.

Legge and Brooman 1997, p. 40. 

Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of "Humanity Dick," who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture its attention.  It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a costermongera street seller of fruitarrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animals injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey. Phelps 2007, pp. 98100.

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
  argued in 1839 that the view of cruelty as wrong only because it hardens humans was "revolting and abominable." Schopenhauer, Arthur. On the Basis of Morality. This edition Hackett Publishing, 1998, p. 96. ]]

The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer (17881860). He wrote that Europeans were "awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man." He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism, arguing that, so long as an animals death was quick, men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten. Nevertheless, he applauded the animal protection movement in England"To the honor, then, of the English, be it said that they are the first people who have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to animals." Phelps 2007, p. 153154.
*Schopenhauer wrote in The Basis of Morality: "It is asserted that beasts have no rights&nbsp;... that there are no duties to be fulfilled towards animals. Such a view is one of revolting coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism." A few passages later, he called the idea that animals exist for human benefit a "Jewish stence." See Phelps, op cit.  He also argued against the dominant Kantian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans:

 Thus, because Christian morality leaves animals out of account&nbsp;... they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere "things," mere means to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, chandalas, and Mleccha|mlechchhas, and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing&nbsp;...  

====Charles Darwin====
  wrote in 1837: "Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"]]
  (1871), he argued: "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties," attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy and imagination. Rachels (2009), pp. 124126; Beauchamp (2009), pp. 248249. 

Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities, arguing that "humanity to the lower animals" was one of the "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported vivisection for "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror&nbsp;..." In 1875 he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally. 

====Friedrich Nietzsche====
 
Avoiding utilitarianism, Friedrich Nietzsche found other reasons to defend animals. He argued that "The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion."  He once wrote: "For man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his heaven on earth."  Throughout his writings, he speaks of the human being as an animal. 

====American SPCA, Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford====
  founded two of the first anti-vivisection groups.]]
 , one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, published The Perfect Way in Diet (1881), advocating vegetarianism.]]
The first animal protection group in the United States, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), was founded by Henry Bergh in April 1866. Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia, and had been disturbed by the treatment of animals there. He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London, and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights, cockfights, and the beating of horses. He created a "Declaration of the Rights of Animals," and in 1866 persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti-cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it. 

In 1875, the Irish social reformer Frances Power Cobbe (18221904) founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection, the worlds first organization opposed to animal research, which became the National Anti-Vivisection Society. In 1880, the English feminist Anna Kingsford (18461888) became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published The Perfect Way in Diet (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society. She was also vocal in her opposition to animal experiments. Rudacille (2000), pp. 31, 46.
*Also see Vyvyan (1969).  In 1898, Cobbe set up the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research, coming close to success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law. 

Ryder writes that, as the interest in animal protection grew in the late 1890s, attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden. They embraced the idea that what they saw as anthropomorphismthe attribution of human qualities to nonhumanswas unscientific. Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only, as Ivan Pavlov wrote in 1927, "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states." It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the 17th century, that nonhumans were purely mechanical, with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness. Ryder (2000), pp. 56. 

====John Stuart Mill====
John Stuart Mill (18061873), the English philosopher, also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account, writing in 1864:  "Nothing is more natural to human beings, nor, up to a certain point in cultivation, more universal, than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves.&nbsp;... Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer immoral, let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned." 

====Henry Salt==== Henry Salt (18511939), a former master at Eton College|Eton, who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before, published Animals Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress.  He wrote that the object of the essay was to "set the principle of animals rights on a consistent and intelligible footing."  Concessions to the demands for jus animalium had been made grudgingly to date, he wrote, with an eye on the interests of animals qua property, rather than as rights bearers:

 Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient onethe assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that "restricted freedom" to which Herbert Spencer alludes.  . Salt cited Spencers definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man&nbsp;... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom&nbsp;... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."  

He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. "  notion of the life of an animal having no moral purpose, belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present dayit is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a great gulf fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood." 

===20th century: Animal rights movement===
====Brown Dog Affair, Lizzy Lind af Hageby====
 
  (centre, seated) in 1913]]
In 1902,  , and his colleagues. After Stephen Coleridge of the National Anti-Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, Bayliss sued and won, convincing a court that the animal had been anaesthetized as required by the Act. 

In response, anti-vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in 1906, with the plaque: "Men and Women of England, how long shall these Things be?" The statue caused uproar among medical students, leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a 24-hour police guard. The affair culminated in riots in 1907 when 1,000 medical students clashed with police, suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square. Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later. Mason (1997).  Coral Lansbury (1985) and Hilda Kean (1998) write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the "Brown Dog Done to Death," which became a symbol of the oppression the womens suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment. Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti-science sentimentality, while the women saw themselves as progressive, with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age. 

====Development of veganism====
 
Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The International Vegetarian Union cites an article about alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Societys magazine in 1851 as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid animal products entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society from the start of the 20th century onwards about consuming eggs and milk, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the "ideal position for vegetarians is abstinence from animal products." Mahatma Gandhi (18691948) argued in 1931 before a meeting of the Society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals, and not only as a human health issue. He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford, and read Salts A Plea for Vegetarianism (1880); Salt wrote in the pamphlet that "a Vegetarian is still regarded, in ordinary society, as little better than a madman."  In 1944, several members, led by Donald Watson (19102005), decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of eggs and milk. Watson coined the term "vegan" for those whose diet included no animal products, and they formed the British Vegan Society on November 1 that year. Leneman (1999)

====Tierschutzgesetz====
 
On coming to power in January 1933, the Nazi Party passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws. The laws were similar to those that already existed in England, though more detailed and with severe penalties for breaking them. Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax write that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals, not by treating animals as persons, but by treating persons as animals. Arluke and Sax (1992).  Kathleen Kete writes that it was the worst possible answer to the question of what our relationship with other species ought to be.  , citing Arluke and Sax (1992). 

 , a German satirical magazine, on September 3, 1933, showing lab animals giving the Nazi salute to Hermann Gring, after restrictions on animal testing were announced.]]
In April 1933 they passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals; one of their targets was  , Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler, adopted some form of vegetarianism, though by most accounts not strictly.  Despite the apparent concern for animals, Arluke and Sax (1992) write that, to earn their stripes, SS personnel who worked with German shepherd dogs allegedly had to break their dogs neck in front of an officer. 

Shortly before the Tierschutzgesetz was introduced, vivisection was first banned, then restricted. Animal research was viewed as part of "Jewish science," and "internationalist" medicine, indicating a mechanistic mind that saw nature as something to be dominated, rather than respected. Hermann Gring first announced a ban on August 16, 1933, but Hitlers personal physician, Dr. Morrel, persuaded Hitler that this was not in the interests of German research, and in particular defence research.  The ban was therefore revised three weeks later, when eight conditions were announced under which animal tests could be conducted, with a view to reducing pain and unnecessary experiments.  Primates, horses, dogs, and cats were given special protection, and licenses to conduct vivisection were to be given to institutions, not to individuals.  The removal of the ban was justified with the announcement: "It is a law of every community that, when necessary, single individuals are sacrificed in the interests of the entire body." 
 Romani children Auschwitz by Dr. Josef Mengele, and on others regarded as inferior, including prisoners-of-war. Because the human subjects were often in such poor health, researchers feared that the results of the experiments were unreliable, and so human experiments were repeated on animals. Dr Hans Nachtheim, for example, induced epilepsy on human adults and children without their consent by injecting them with pentylenetetrazol|cardiazol, then repeated the experiments on rabbits to check the results. Sax (2000), pp. 112113. 

====Increase in animal use====
Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.  Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century, the situation for animals arguably deteriorated in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research300 in the UK in 1875, 19,084 in 1903, and 2.8 million in 2005 (50100 million worldwide), and a modern annual estimated range of 10 million to upwards of 100 million in the US  , Her Majestys Stationery Office.

====Development of direct action====
 
In the early 1960s in England, support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of blood sports, particularly hunting deer, Foxhunting|foxes, and otters using dogs, an aristocratic and middle-class English practice, stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions. The psychologist Richard D. Ryder  who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late 1960s  writes that the new chair of the League Against Cruel Sports tried in 1963 to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt, which triggered the formation that year of a direct action breakaway group, the Hunt Saboteurs Association. This was set up by a journalist, John Prestige, who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the Devon and Somerset Staghounds. The practice of sabotaging hunts (for example, by misleading the dogs with scents or horns) spread throughout south-east England, particularly around university towns, leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the "sabs". Ryder (2000), p. 167ff. 

The controversy spread to the RSPCA, which had arguably grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage. It had failed to speak out against hunting, and indeed counted huntsmen among its members. As with the League Against Cruel Sports, this position gave rise to a splinter group, the RSPCA Reform Group, which sought to radicalize the organization, leading to chaotic meetings of the groups ruling Council, and successful (though short-lived) efforts to change it from within by electing to the Council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective, and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting, factory farming, and animal experimentation. Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979. 

====Formation of the Oxford group====
 
The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favour of animal rights. Ruth Harrison published Animal Machines (1964), an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the novelist Brigid Brophy had an article, "The Rights of Animals," published in The Sunday Times.  She wrote:

 The relationship of homo sapiens to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrail in the hopeor on the mere offchancethat we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present&nbsp;... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.  

  David Wood, now known as the Oxford Group. They decided to put together a symposium to discuss the theory of animal rights. 

Around the same time, Richard Ryder wrote several letters to The Daily Telegraph criticizing animal experimentation, based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories. The letters, published in April and May 1969, were seen by Brigid Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals; it was in one of these pamphlets in 1970 that he coined the term " . 

====Publication of Animal Liberation====
 
In 1970, over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen, a vegetarian, Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that, by eating animals, he was engaging in the oppression of other species. Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches, and in 1973 Singer reviewed their book for The New York Review of Books. In the review, he used the term "animal liberation," writing:
 Animal Liberation (1975)]]
 We are familiar with Black Liberation, Gay Liberation, and a variety of other movements. With Womens Liberation some thought we had come to the end of the road. Discrimination on the basis of sex, it has been said, is the last form of discrimination that is universally accepted and practiced without pretense&nbsp;... But one should always be wary of talking of "the last remaining form of discrimination."&nbsp;... Animals, Men and Morals is a manifesto for an Animal Liberation movement.  

On the strength of his review, The New York Review of Books took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as Animal Liberation, now one of the animal rights movements canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism  the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the "greatest happiness of the greatest number," a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham.   .
*Singer (1990), pp. xivxv.
*Also see  , letter from David Rosinger and reply from Peter Singer, The New York Review of Books, Volume 20, Number 10, June 14, 1973.  He argued in favor of the equal consideration of interests, the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a humanfor example, an interest in not sufferingis different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman. Singer 1990, p. 5.  Singer used the term "speciesism" in the book, citing Ryder, and it stuck, becoming an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1989. 

The books publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights.  s Animal Rights: A Christian Perspective (1976), and   led to his The Case for Animal Rights (1984), in which he argues that nonhuman animals are "subjects-of-a-life," and therefore possessors of moral rights, a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory.  Regan wrote in 2001 that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous 20 years than in the 2,000 years before that.  Garner writes that Charles Magels bibliography, Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights (1989), contains 10 pages of philosophical material on animals up to 1970, but 13 pages between 1970 and 1989 alone. Garner (2004), p. 2.

====Founding of the Animal Liberation Front====
 
In 1971 a law student, Ronnie Lee, formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton, later calling it the Band of Mercy after a 19th-century RSPCA youth group. The Band attacked hunters vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows, calling it "active compassion." In November 1973 they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory, claiming responsibility as a "nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind." Molland (2004), pp. 7074; Monaghan (2000), pp. 160161. 

  groups in England in 1963.]]
Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976 Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a leaderless resistance movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).  ALF activists see themselves as a modern Underground Railroad, passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries.  Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion. 

The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, because they tend to be organized around friends.  In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats.  The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as Ingrid Newkirk puts it, "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out." Newkirk (2004), p. 341./ 

====Animal Rights International====
 
  in the 1970s]]
Henry Spira (19271998), a former seaman and civil rights activist, became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States. A proponent of gradual change, he formed Animal Rights International in 1974, and introduced the idea of "reintegrative shaming," whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals, with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice. It is a strategy that has been widely adopted, most notably by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 

Spiras first campaign was in opposition to the American Museum of Natural History in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. His most notable achievement was in 1980, when he convinced the cosmetics company Revlon to stop using the Draize test, which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, "How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beautys sake?" Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies.

===21st century: Developments===
In 1999, New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on "non-human hominids."  

Also in 1999, Public Law 106-152 (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them.  

In 2005, the Austrian parliament banned experiments on apes, unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape.  Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his personhood) was not a person, after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in Sierra Leone in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelters bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzees personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property.  , Associated Press, January 15, 2008.

The parliamentary Environment Committee recommended giving chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans the right not to be used in medical experiments or in circuses, and recommended making it illegal to kill apes, except in self-defense, based upon the rights recommended by the Great Ape Project.

From 2009 onwards, several countries outlawed the use of some or all animals in circuses, starting with Bolivia, and followed by several countries in Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East, and Singapore. 

In 2010, the government in Catalonia passed a motion to outlaw bull fighting, the first such ban in Spain.  In 2011, PETA sued SeaWorld over the captivity of five orcas in San Diego and Orlando, arguing that the whales were being treated as slaves. It was the first time the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude, was cited in court to protect nonhuman rights.

==Indian subcontinent==
===Religions=== Hindu and Buddhist societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. Several kings in India built hospitals for animals, and the emperor Ashoka (304232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ahimsa, the doctrine of non-violence. Garner writes that Jainism took this idea further. Jains believe that no living creature should be harmed, and they are known to clear the path in front of them by sweeping it to protect insect life. 

===Legal actions in the 21st century===
Paul Waldau writes that, in 2000, the High Court in Kerala used the language of "rights" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are "beings entitled to dignified existence" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said: "It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognise and protect their rights." Waldau writes that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language. Waldau (2011), p. 108. 

In 2012, the Indian government issued an extensive ban of vivisection in education and research. 
 

==Islam==
 
Animal rights were recognized early by the Sharia (Islamic law). This recognition is based on both the Quran and the Hadith. In the Quran, there are many references to animals, all positive. They have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. The Prophet Muhammad forbade his followers to harm any animal and asked them to respect the rights of animals. It is a distinctive characteristic of the Shar`iah that all animals have legal rights. Othman Llewellyn even argues that Shari`ah has mechanisms for the full repair of injuries suffered by non-human creatures including their representation in court, assessment of injuries and awarding of relief to them. The classical Muslim jurist `Izz ad-Din ibn `Abd as-Salam, who flourished during the thirteenth century, formulated the following statement of animal rights:

The rights of livestock and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, even if they have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of their own kind or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and their lives have passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.

==Philosophical and legal approaches==
===Overview===
  capabilities approach to animal rights.]]
The two main philosophical approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, and the latter by Tom Regan and Gary Francione. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those that focus on the principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome. 
 contractarian approach.  

===Utilitarianism===
 
  preference utilitarian, meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected. 

His position is that there is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration. Singer (1990), pp. 78.  Singer quotes the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (18381900): "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view&nbsp;... of the Universe, than the good of any other." 

 : interests are predicated on the ability to suffer.]]
Singer argues that equality of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if the equality of the sexes were based only on the idea that men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer. Singer (1990), p. 4. 

Commentators on all sides of the debate now accept that animals suffer and feel pain, although it was not always so.  . Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that there is no reason to suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans. 

===Subjects-of-a-life===
 
 : animals are subjects-of-a-life.]] cognitive abilities, intrinsic value" as subjects-of-a-life, and cannot be regarded as a means to an end, a view that places him firmly in the abolitionist camp. His theory does not extend to all animals, but only to those that can be regarded as subjects-of-a-life.  He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify:

 ...&nbsp;individuals are subjects-of-a-life if they have beliefs and desires; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate action in pursuit of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an individual welfare in the sense that their experiential life fares well or ill for them, logically independently of their utility for others and logically independently of their being the object of anyone elses interests.  
 Kantian ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they ought never to be sacrificed as a means to an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves. 

===Abolitionism===
 
 : animals need only the right not to be regarded as property.]]
Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that paradigm shift. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, "in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." The law only requires that any suffering not be "unnecessary." In deciding what counts as "unnecessary," an animals interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail. 
 slaves in Animal Welfare Act, which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement. 
 new welfarists," arguing that they have more in common with 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms "animal protection" and "protectionism" are increasingly favored. His position in 1996 was that there is no animal rights movement in the United States.

*Hall, Lee.  , Friends of Animals, accessed February 3, 2011. 

===Contractarianism===
 
Mark Rowlands, professor of philosophy at the University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on the original position and the veil of ignorancea "state of nature" thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairnessin John Rawlss A Theory of Justice (1971). In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristicstheir race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poorand therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society they are about to form. The idea is that, operating behind the veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract in which there is basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending the veil of ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics such as race, sex and intelligence. Rowlands (1998), p. 118ff, particularly pp. 147152. 

===Prima facie rights theory===
 
American philosopher Timothy Garry has proposed an approach that deems nonhuman animals worthy of prima facie rights. In a philosophical context, a prima facie (Latin for "on the face of it" or "at first glance") right is one that appears to be applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory, Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as "the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation". Hinman, Lawrence M. Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College, 1998. Print.  The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of prima facie rights is to say that, in a sense, animals do have rights. However, these rights can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a humans right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Garry supports his view arguing:

 ...&nbsp;if a nonhuman animal were to kill a human being in the U.S., it would have broken the laws of the land and would probably get rougher sanctions than if it were a human.  My point is that like laws govern all who interact within a society, rights are to be applied to all beings who interact within that society.  This is not to say these rights endowed by humans are equivalent to those held by nonhuman animals, but rather that if humans possess rights then so must all those who interact with humans. Garry, Timothy J. Nonhuman Animals: Possessors of Prima Facie Rights (2012), p.6  

In sum, Garry suggests that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; however, animals do not, and ought not to, have uninfringible rights against humans.

===Feminism and animal rights===
  Carol Adams has written extensively about the link between feminism and animal rights, starting with The Sexual Politics of Meat (1990).]]
Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century. Lansbury (1985); Adams (1990); Donovan (1993); Gruen (1993); Adams (1994); Adams and Donovan (1995); Adams (2004); MacKinnon (2004).  The anti-vivisection movement in the 19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was largely run by women, including Francis Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford, Lizzy Lind af Hageby and Caroline Earle White (18331916).  Garner writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in 1900. 

The modern animal advocacy movement has a similar representation of women, though Garner (2005) writes that they are not invariably in leadership positions: during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C., in 1990the largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United Statesmost of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men. Garner (2005), pp. 142143.  Nevertheless, several influential animal advocacy groups have been founded by women, including the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection by Cobbe in London in 1898; the Animal Welfare Board of India by Rukmini Devi Arundale in 1962; and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, co-founded by Ingrid Newkirk in 1980. In the Netherlands, Marianne Thieme and Esther Ouwehand were elected to parliament in 2006 representing the Party for Animals.
 Thomas Taylor (17581835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes (1792), showing that Wollstonecrafts arguments for womens rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as an reductio ad absurdum.  

===Critics===
====R. G. Frey====
R. G. Frey, professor of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order beliefa belief about the beliefwhich he argues requires language: "If someone were to say, e.g. The cat believes that the door is locked, then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence The door is locked to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." 

====Carl Cohen====
Carl Cohen, professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that rights holders must be able to distinguish between their own interests and what is right. "The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules,  &nbsp;... must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked." Cohen rejects Singers argument that, since a brain-damaged human could not make moral judgments, moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen writes that the test for moral judgment "is not a test to be administered to humans one by one," but should be applied to the capacity of members of the species in general.  .
*Cohen and Regan (2001). 

====Richard Posner====
 : "facts will drive equality." ]] moral intuition tells him "that human beings prefer their own. If a dog threatens a human infant, even if it requires causing more pain to the dog to stop it, than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we favour the child. It would be monstrous to spare the dog."  ;  , courtesy link on utilitarian.net].
*Also see Posner (2004). 

Singer challenges this by arguing that formerly unequal rights for gays, women, and certain races were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were no morally significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support inequality. If and when similar facts emerge about humans and animals, the differences in rights will erode too. But facts will drive equality, not ethical arguments that run contrary to instinct, he argues. Posner calls his approach "soft utilitarianism," in contrast to Singers "hard utilitarianism." He argues:

 The "soft" utilitarian position on animal rights is a moral intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.  

 : rights imply obligations.]]

====Roger Scruton====
 , attributing traits to animals that are, he says, Beatrix Potter-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgemental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape. Scruton, Roger.  , City Journal, summer 2000.

==Continuity between humans and nonhuman animals==

==Public attitudes== companion animals may be a factor in peoples attitudes. Signal, Tania; Taylor, Nicola. (2006). "Attitudes to Animals: Demographics Within a Community Sample". Society & Animals, 14:2, pages 147157. doi:10.1163/156853006776778743 

Gender has repeatedly been shown to be a factor in how people view animals, with women more likely to support animal rights than men.   A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards feminism and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on "nurturance or compassion" amongst women. 
 creationists and Christian fundamentalists and believers in creationism were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were atheists or agnostic.  

Two surveys found that attitudes towards animal rights tactics, such as direct action, are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists do not support direct action. One survey concluded "it would be a mistake to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous."
