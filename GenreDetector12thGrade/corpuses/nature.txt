 phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the universe|cosmic.

The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".    Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.   The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word  by Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.  

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to  , the supernatural, or Artifact (archaeology)|synthetic.

Earth (or, "the earth") is the only planet presently known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.

 atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,  which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,  and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750&nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540&nbsp;million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180&nbsp;million years ago.

 mass extinctions.  The last mass extinction occurred some 65 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the Bird|non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past 65&nbsp;million years, mammalian life diversified. 

Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.  The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300&nbsp;million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.   Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100&nbsp;years.  The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary   (a mathematical constant

}}   The ozone layer of the Earths atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.
 lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, Headlands and bays|gulfs, bays and other names.

It is not known if Titans lakes are fed by rivers, though Titans surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glacier|glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of  , atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that  , and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.   The human ecosystem concept is grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature dichotomy and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope. 

A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.

Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.  More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,  and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50&nbsp;million.    The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.   The total number of species is presently in rapid decline.   

===Evolution=== diversity of species on Earth.  ]]
 
Life is only known to exist on the planet Earth.(cf Astrobiology) The origin of life is still a poorly understood process, but it is thought to have occurred about 3.9 to 3.5&nbsp;billion years ago during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.    These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms. 
 development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.  Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.

===Microbes===

The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life on the planet until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. {{cite journal | title = journal = volume = issue = pages = year = pmid = doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6735 |

These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including the interior of rocks within the planet. 
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse. The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer  ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in n
