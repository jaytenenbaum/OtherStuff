 divided into cited by book, chapter, and verse. The Bible has estimated annual sales of 25 million copies,     and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the West where it was the first mass printed book.

==Etymology==
 
The English word   is from the Latin biblia, from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from Koine Greek   ta biblia "the books" (singular   biblion).   

Medieval Latin biblia is short for biblia sacra "holy book", while biblia in Greek and Late Latin is neuter plural (gen. bibliorum). It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as a singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe. 
Latin biblia sacra "holy books" translates Greek   ta biblia ta hagia, "the holy books". 

The word   itself had the literal meaning of "paper" or "scroll" and came to be used as the ordinary word for "book".
It is the diminutive of   bublos, "Egyptian papyrus", possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician sea port Byblos (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece.
The Greek ta biblia (lit. "little papyrus books") Stagg, Frank. New Testament Theology. Nashville: Broadman, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7.  was "an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books (the Septuagint).   Christian use of the term can be traced to ca. 223 CE.  The biblical scholar F.F. Bruce notes that Chrysostom appears to be the first writer (in his Homilies on Matthew, delivered between 386 and 388) to use the Greek phrase ta biblia ("the books") to describe both the Old and New Testaments together. 
 

==Hebrew Bible==
 
  (2nd century BCE) contains a portion of a pre-Masoretic Text, specifically the Ten Commandments and the Shema Yisrael prayer.]] Hebrew text books of vocalization and cantillation|accentuation.

The oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,  and the Aleppo Codex (once the oldest complete copy of the Masoretic Text, but now missing its Torah section) dates from the 10th century.

  ("Teaching"), Neviim ("Prophets") and Ketuvim ("Writings").

===Torah===
 
  first words in the respective texts.

The Torah comprises the following five books:
* Book of Genesis|Genesis, Bereshith ()
* Book of Exodus|Exodus, Shemot ()
* Book of Leviticus|Leviticus, Vayikra ()
* Book of Numbers|Numbers, Bamidbar ()
* Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy, Devarim ()
 creation (or covenant with Biblical patriarchs Mount Sinai and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation was ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses. 
 Jewish religious law. Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (taryag mitzvot).

===Neviim===
 
 
Neviim ( , "Prophets") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. It contains two sub-groups, the Former Prophets ( , the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets ( , the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).

The Neviim tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy and its division into two kingdoms, ancient Israel and Judah, focusing on conflicts between the Israelites and other nations, and conflicts among Israelites, specifically, struggles between believers in "the   God"  and believers in foreign gods,   and the criticism of unethical and unjust behavior of Israelite elites and rulers;    in which prophets played a crucial and leading role. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians followed by the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.

====Former Prophets====
The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:
* Joshuas conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua),
* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges),
* the peoples request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the books of 1st & 2nd Samuel)
* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (1st and 2nd Kings)

=====Joshua=====
The Book of Joshua (Yehoshua ) contains a history of the Israelites from the death of Moses to that of Joshua. After Moses death, Joshua, by virtue of his previous appointment as Moses successor, receives from God the command to cross the Jordan River.

The book consists of three parts:
* the history of the conquest of the land (112).
* allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (1322), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes.
* the farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23, 24).

=====Judges=====
The Book of Judges (Shoftim ) consists of three distinct parts:
* the introduction (1:13:10 and 3:12) giving a summary of the book of Joshua
* the main text (3:1116:31), discussing the five Great Judges, Abimelech, and providing glosses for a few minor Judges
* appendices (17:121:25), giving two stories set in the time of the Judges, but not discussing the Judges themselves.

=====Samuel=====
The Books of Samuel (Shmuel ) consists of five parts:
* the period of Gods rejection of Eli (Biblical priest)|Eli, Samuel (biblical figure)|Samuels birth, and subsequent judgment (1 Samuel 1:17:17)
* the life of Saul prior to meeting David (1 Samuel 8:115:35)
* Sauls interaction with David (1 Samuel 16:12 Samuel 1:27)
* Davids reign and the rebellions he suffers (2 Samuel 2:120:22)
* an appendix of material concerning David in no particular order, and out of sequence with the rest of the text (2 Samuel 22:124:25)

A conclusion of sorts appears at   is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.

=====Kings===== Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians.

====Latter Prophets====
The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the "major" prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets, collected into a single book.

=====Isaiah===== Isaiah (Yeshayahu Israel (the northern kingdom), Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, and Phoenicia. The prophecies concerning them can be summarized as saying that Jehovah is the God of the whole earth, and that nations which think of themselves as secure in their own power might well be conquered by other nations, at Gods command.

Chapter 6 describes Isaiahs call to be a prophet of God. Chapters 3539 provide material about King Hezekiah. Chapters 2434, while too complex to characterize easily, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a messiah, the Lords "chosen one", a person anointed or given power by God, and of the messiahs kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign. This section is seen by Jews as describing an king, a descendant of their great king, David, who will make Judah a great kingdom and Jerusalem a truly holy city.

The prophecy continues with what can be characterized as a "book of comfort"  which begins in chapter 40 and completes the writing. In the first eight chapters of this book of comfort, Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of the   is named as the messiah who will overthrow the Babylonians and allow the return of Israel to their original land. The remaining chapters of the book contain prophecies of the future glory of Zion under the rule of a righteous servant (52 and 54). Chapter 53 contains a poetic prophecy about this servant which is generally considered by Christians to refer to Jesus, although Jews generally interpret it as a reference to Gods people. Although there is still the mention of judgment of false worshippers and idolaters (65 & 66), the book ends with a message of hope of a righteous ruler who extends salvation to his righteous subjects living in the Lords kingdom on earth.

=====Jeremiah=====
The Book of Jeremiah (Yirmiyahu  ) can be divided into twenty-three subsections, and its contents organized into five sub-sections:
* the introduction, ch. 1
* scorn for the sins of Israel, consisting of seven sections, (1.) ch. 2; (2.) ch. 36; (3.) ch. 710; (4.) ch. 1113; (5.) ch. 1417:18; (6.) ch. 17:19ch. 20; (7.) ch. 2124
* a general review of all nations, foreseeing their destruction, in two sections, (1.) ch. 4649; (2.) ch. 25; with an historical appendix of three sections, (1.) ch. 26; (2.) ch. 27; (3.) ch. 28, 29
* two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32, 33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, (1.) ch. 34:17; (2.) ch. 34:822; (3.) ch. 35
# the conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.

In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 3739; 4043; and 44. The principal messianic prophecies are found in 23:18; 31:3140; and 33:1426.

Jeremiahs prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words, phrases, and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not in chronological order.

=====Ezekiel=====
The Book of Ezekiel (Yehezqel  ) contains three distinct sections.
* the Judgment on Israel  Ezekiel makes a series of denunciations against his fellow Judeans (  ), warning them of the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the false prophets ( ). The symbolic acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in  , show his intimate acquaintance with the levitical legislation. (See, for example,    ; Leviticus  ;  ;  ;  ;  )
* prophecies against various neighboring nations, the  ites (  ), the   (  ),   ( )
* prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by  , and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God ( ).

=====Twelve Minor Prophets=====
The Twelve, Trei Asar ( ), also called the Twelve Minor Prophets
* Book of Hosea|Hosea, Hoshea ()
* Book of Joel|Joel, Yoel ()
* Book of Amos|Amos, Amos ()
* Book of Obadiah|Obadiah, Ovadyah ()
* Book of Jonah|Jonah, Yonah ()
* Book of Micah|Micah, Mikhah ()
* Book of Nahum|Nahum, Nahum ()
* Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk, Havakuk ()
* Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah, Tsefanya ()
* Book of Haggai|Haggai, Khagay ()
* Book of Zechariah|Zechariah, Zekharyah ()
* Book of Malachi|Malachi, Malakhi ()

===Ketuvim===
 
 
Ketuvim or Km (in   "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh. The Ketuvim are believed to have been written under the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) but with one level less authority than that of prophecy. 

====The poetic books====
In Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stitches in the verses, which are a function of their Biblical poetry|poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, , ,  yields Emet ", which is also the Hebrew for "truth").

These three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.

====The five scrolls (Hamesh Megillot)====
The five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Hamesh Megillot (Five Megillot). These are the latest books collected and designated as "authoritative" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE. 

====Other books====
Besides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Book of Daniel|Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:
* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).
* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.
* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in Tanakh with significant portions in Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic.

====Order of the books====
The following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of Sifrei Emet and Hamesh Megillot.

The Three Poetic Books (Sifrei Emet)
* Tehillim (Psalms) 
* Mishlei (Book of Proverbs) 
* Iyybh (Book of Job) 
The Five Megillot (Hamesh Megillot)
* Shr Hashshrm (Song of Songs) or (Song of Solomon)   (Passover)
* Rth (Book of Ruth)  (Shbhth)
* Eikhah (Book of Lamentations|Lamentations)  (Ninth of Av)  
* Qheleth (Ecclesiastes)  (Sukkth)
* Estr (Book of Esther)  (Prm)
Other books
* Dnl (Book of Daniel) 
* Ezr (Book of Ezra-Book of Nehemiah) 
* Divrei ha-Yamim (Books of Chronicles|Chronicles)  
 Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles. 

In Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Esther, Daniel, Ezra. 

====Canonization==== Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the Common Era. 

Evidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title.  References in the four Gospels as well as other books of the New Testament that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.
 Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which "... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable..."  For a long time following this date the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny. 

===Original languages===
The Tanakh was mainly written in biblical Hebrew, with some portions (  and  ,  ,  ) in biblical Aramaic, a sister language which became the lingua franca of the Semitic world. Sir Godfrey Driver. "Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible." Web: 30 November 2009 

==Septuagint==
 
The Septuagint, or LXX, is a translation of the Hebrew scriptures and some related texts into Koine Greek, begun in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132&nbsp;BCE,    initially in Alexandria, but in time elsewhere as well.    It is not altogether clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised. 
 hagiographical works Maccabees and Wisdom of Daniel and Wisdom of second book of Maccabees) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek. 
 Council of Jamnia, mainstream Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.  Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity. "  die griechische Bibelbersetzung, die einem innerjdischen Bedrfnis entsprang     Rabbinen zuerst gerhmt (..) Spter jedoch, als manche ungenaue bertragung des hebrischen Textes in der Septuaginta und bersetzungsfehler die Grundlage fr hellenistische Irrlehren abgaben, lehte man die Septuaginta ab." Verband der Deutschen Juden (Hrsg.), neu hrsg. von Walter Homolka, Walter Jacob, Tovia Ben Chorin: Die Lehren des Judentums nach den Quellen; Mnchen, Knesebeck, 1999, Bd.3, S. 43ff  
Finally, the rabbis claimed for the Hebrew language a divine authority, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek - even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given the same holy language status as Hebrew). 
 King James Version of the Bible, the basis for the Revised Standard Version. 

===Incorporations from Theodotion===
In most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotions translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic text. The Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotions version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. Jerome reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, "This thing just happened."    One of two Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel has been recently rediscovered and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book. Jennifer M. Dines, The Septuagint, Michael A. Knibb, Ed., London: T&T Clark, 2004. 

The canonical Ezra-Nehemiah is known in the Septuagint as "Esdras B", and 1 Esdras is "Esdras A". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra-Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that "Esdras B"  the canonical Ezra-Nehemiah  is Theodotions version of this material, and "Esdras A" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own. 

===Final form=== Wisdom of Wisdom of The Prayer Song of Susanna and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Book of Esther|Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Book of Odes (Bible)|Odes, including the Prayer of Manasseh, the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.

Some books that are set apart in the Masoretic text are grouped together. For example the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are in the LXX one book in four parts called  ("Of Reigns"). In LXX, the Books of Chronicles supplement Reigns and it is called Paralipomenon (things left out). The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets as twelve parts of one Book of Twelve.

==Christian Bibles==
  divinely inspired Early Church apostles did developed over time. Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.

Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Revised Standard Version, the Authorized King James Version, the American Standard Version, the English Standard Version, the New King James Version, and the New International Version.

===Old Testament===
 
The books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestants churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholics and Orthodox have wider canons. A few groups consider particular translations to be divinely inspired, notably the Greek Septuagint, the Aramaic Peshitta, and the English King James Version. 

====Apocryphal or deuterocanonical books==== Western languages. 14th century make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic Text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text.  They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts, e.g., those discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.  
 Peshitta or Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 15451563.   It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New. 
 Protestant traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles included them in Apocrypha sections until the 1820s. However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:  .
   Tobit
* Judith
* 1 Maccabees
* 2 Maccabees Wisdom
* Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus) Baruch
* The Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch Chapter 6) Greek Additions to Esther (Book of Esther, chapters 10:4  12:6)
* The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children verses 168 (Book of Daniel, chapter 3, verses 2490) Susanna (Book of Daniel, chapter 13)
* Bel and the Dragon (Book of Daniel, chapter 14)
 Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following:  
* 3 Maccabees
* 1 Esdras
* Prayer of Manasseh
* Psalm 151

Russian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include: 
* 2 Esdras i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles
 Georgian Church, but was included by St. Jerome in an appendix to the Vulgate, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha. 
 Syriac Orthodox tradition includes:  Psalms 151155 Apocalypse of Baruch The Letter of Baruch

The Ethiopian Biblical canon includes: 
* Jubilees Enoch
* Meqabyan|13 Meqabyan
and some other books.
 Apocryphal books liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, which were in the Vulgate appendix.  

====Role in Christian theology====
 
The Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar N.T. Wright says "Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures."  He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the ancient Israelites scriptures as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the "new covenant" prophesied by Jeremiah. Wright, N.T. The Last Word: Scripture and the Authority of GodGetting Beyond the Bible Wars. HarperCollins, 2005. ISBN 0-06-087261-6 / 9780060872618 

===New Testament===
 
The New Testament is a collection of 27 books  of 4 different genres of Christian literature (Gospels, one account of the Acts of the Apostles, Epistles and an Apocalyptic literature|Apocalypse). Jesus is its central figure. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old Testament  (2 Timothy 3:16). Nearly all Christians recognize the New Testament as canonical scripture. These books can be grouped into:

 
  The Gospels
* Synoptic Gospels Gospel According to Matthew Gospel According to Mark Gospel According to Luke Gospel According to John
* Acts of the Apostles

Pauline Epistles
* Epistle to the Romans
* First Epistle to the Corinthians
* Second Epistle to the Corinthians
* Epistle to the Galatians
* Epistle to the Ephesians
* Epistle to the Philippians
* Epistle to the Colossians
* First Epistle to the Thessalonians
* Second Epistle to the Thessalonians
 

Pastoral epistles
* First Epistle to Timothy
* Second Epistle to Timothy
* Epistle to Titus
* Epistle to Philemon
* Epistle to the Hebrews

General epistles, also called Catholic epistles
* Epistle of James
* First Epistle of Peter
* Second Epistle of Peter
* First Epistle of John
* Second Epistle of John
* Third Epistle of John
* Epistle of Jude

 manuscripts written manuscript traditions. marginal glosses) to correct their textespecially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or lineand to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions. 

The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the Alexandrian text-type (generally minimalist), the Byzantine text-type (generally maximalist), and the Western text-type (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

===Development of the Christian canons===
 
The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46(51),54, or 57 book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in AD 393. Also c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time. A definitive list did not come from an Ecumenical Council until the Council of Trent (154563). 

During the Protestant Reformation, certain reformers proposed different canonical lists to those currently in use. Though not without debate, see Antilegomena, the list of New Testament books would come to remain the same; however, the Old Testament texts present in the Septuagint but not included in the Jewish canon fell out of favor. In time they would come to be removed from most Protestant canons. Hence, in a Catholic context, these texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as the Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha, which means "hidden", the label applied to all texts excluded from the biblical canon but which were in the Septuagint. It should also be noted that Catholics and Protestants both describe certain other books, such as the Acts of Peter, as New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal.  

Thus, the Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canonthe number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of divisionwhile the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognise 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognises a longer canon. The term "Hebrew Scriptures" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.
