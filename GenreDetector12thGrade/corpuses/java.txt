==Etymology==
The origins of the name "Java" are not clear. One possibility is that the island was named after the   yava means barley, a plant for which the island was famous.  "Yawadvipa" is mentioned in Indias earliest epic, the Ramayana. Sugriva, the chief of Ramas army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.  It was hence referred to in Indian, specifically Tamil literature by the Sanskrit name "yvaka dvpa" (dvpa = island). Another source states that the "Java" word is derived from a Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian root word, meaning home. 

==Geography== Bromo in East Java]]
 
Java lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the east.  Borneo lies to the north and Christmas Island to the south. It is the List of islands by area|worlds 13th largest island. Java is surrounded by Java Sea in the north, Sunda Strait in the west, Indian Ocean in the south and Bali Strait and Madura Strait in the east.
 volcanic origin; it contains thirty-eight mountains forming an east-west spine which have at one time or another been active volcanoes. The highest volcano in Java is Mount Semeru (3,676 m). The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is Mount Merapi (2,968 m). See Volcanoes of Java. 

More mountains and highlands help to split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for Paddy field|wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the world. {{cite book

Temperatures throughout the year average 22C to 29C and humidity average 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter averaging 34C during the day in the dry season. The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are cooler again. The wet season begins in October ending in April during which rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. The wettest months are January and February. 

West Java is wetter than East Java and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall. The Parahyangan highlands of West Java receive over 4,000&nbsp;mm annually, while the north coast of East Java receives 900&nbsp;mm annually.

==Natural environment== Ujung Kulon; it is the worlds rarest rhino.]]
The natural environment of Java is tropical rainforest, with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove forests on the north coast, rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and low-lying tropical forests to high altitude rainforests on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior. The Javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east; from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts, to a dry savanna environment in the east, corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.

==History==

  surrounded by rice fields. Javas volcanic topography and rich agricultural lands are the fundamental factor in its history]]

Fossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the "Java Man", dating back 1.7 million years were found along the banks of the Bengawan Solo River.

The islands exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet-field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of Java kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively isolated.  Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism, the rivers provided the main means of communication, although Javas many rivers are mostly short. Only the Brantas and Sala rivers could provide long-distance communication, and this way their valleys supported the centres of major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges and toll gates is thought to have been established in Java by at least the mid-17th century. Local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance. Subsequently, communication between Javas population was difficult. 

===Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms era=== Taruma and Sunda kingdoms of western Java appeared in the 4th and 7th centuries respectively. However, the first major principality was the Medang Kingdom which was founded in central Java at the beginning of the 8th century. Medangs religion centred on the Hindu god Shiva, and the kingdom produced some of Javas earliest Hindu temples on the Dieng Plateau. Around the 8th century the Sailendra dynasty rose in Kedu Plain and become the patron of Mahayana Buddhism. This ancient kingdom built monuments such as the 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.

Around the 10th century the centre of power shifted from central to eastern Java. The eastern Javanese kingdoms of Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit were mainly dependent on rice agriculture, yet also pursued trade within the Indonesian archipelago, and with China and India. 
 Wijaya and coming of Islam to Indonesia, Majapahit went into decline.

===Spread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates=== Banten were ascendant. The Mataram Sultanate became the dominant power of central and eastern Java at the end of the 16th century. The principalities of Surabaya and Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were left to face the Dutch in the 17th century.

===Colonial periods===

 a treaty Portuguese presence was confined to Malacca, and to the eastern islands.
In 1596, a four-ship expedition led by Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutch contact with Indonesia.  By the end of the 18th century the Dutch had extended their influence over the sultanates of the interior (see Dutch East India Company in Indonesia). Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from forming effective alliances against the Dutc
