Baby, we went last winter
And the ground was covered with snow
Yes, we went last winter, baby
And the ground was covered with snow

I didn't have no money in my pocket, darling
Shout aloud and have no place to go

Well, it seems like I was going crazy sometime
I didn't know what to do
Yes, it seems like I was going crazy sometime
Baby, I didn't know what to do

Yeah, I wake up in the morning
Shout and laid down with the blues

Well, I finally got a break, baby
Easy things are coming my way
Yeah, I finally got a break, baby
Easy things are coming my way

I've got money in my pocket, darling
Yes, I can change clothes everyday

Songwriters: Stanley Jones
An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he rode along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yipie I ay, yipie I oh
Ghost turned in the sky

Their horns were black and shiny and their hooks are made of steel
Their brands were still on fire and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear shot through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yipie I ay, yipie I oh
Ghost riders in the sky

Their face is gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on the range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire as they ride on hear them cry

Yipie I ay, yipie I oh
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders looked on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
Then cow-boy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devils herd, across these endless skies

Yipie I ay, yipie I oh
Ghost riders in the sky
Yipie I ay, yipie I oh
Ghost riders in the sky

The earth can shake the sky come down*

The wheels of war are going round 
And all the walls are crumbling 
Shelter me lord underneath your wings 
Shelter me lord underneath your wings

Hide me underneath your wings 
Hide me deep inside your heart 
In your refuge - cover me 
The world can shake 
But lord I'm making you my hiding place 

The wind can blow the rain can pour 
The deluge breaks the tempest roars 
But in the storm my spirit sing 
Oh shelter me lord underneath your wing
Shelter me lord underneath your wing

Hide me underneath your wings
Hide me deep inside your heart 
In your refuge - cover me 
The world can shake 
But lord I'm making you my hiding place 

Now on the day you call for me 
Someday when time - no more shall be 
I'll say death where is your sting 
Shelter me lord underneath your wing
Shelter me lord underneath your wing

Hide me underneath your wings
Hide me deep inside your heart 
In your refuge - cover me

Je L'aime à Mourir
Paroles et musique : Francis Cabrel
(c) 1979 Éditions Marouani

1	Moi je n'étais rien et voilà qu'aujourd'hui,
Je suis le gardien du sommeil de ses nuits. Je l'aime à mourir
Vous pouvez détruire tout ce qui vous plaira
Elle n'a qu'à ouvrir l'espace de ses bras
Pour tout reconstruire. Pour tout reconstruire. Je l'aime à mourir

Elle a gommé les chiffres des horloges du quartier
Elle a fait de ma vie des cocottes en papier, des éclats de rire
Elle a bâti des ponts entre nous et le ciel
Et nous les traversons à chaque fois qu'elle
Ne veut pas dormir. Ne veut pas dormir. Je l'aime à mourir

R	Elle a dû faire toutes les guerres pour être aussi forte aujourd'hui,
Elle a dû faire toutes les guerres de la vie et l'amour aussi.

2	Elle vit de son mieux ses rêves d'opaline
Elle danse au milieu des forêts qu'elle dessine. Je l'aime à mourir
Elle porte des rubans qu'elle laisse s'envoler
Elle me chante souvent que j'ai tort d'essayer
De les retenir. De les retenir. Je l'aime à mourir

Pour monter dans sa grotte cachée sous les toits
Je dois clouer des notes à mes sabots de bois. Je l'aime à mourir
Je dois juste m'asseoir, je ne dois plus parler,
Je ne dois rien vouloir, je dois juste essayer
De lui appartenir. De lui appartenir.

Refrain...

Would you join a slow marching band
And take pleasure in your leaving
As the ferry sails and tears are dried
And cows come home at evening?

Would you get behind a slow marching band
And join together in the passing
Of all we shared through yesterdays
In sorrows neverlasting?

Take the hand and take a bow
You played for me, that's all for now
Oh, and never mind the words
Just hum along and keep on going

Walk on slowly, don't look behind you
Don't say goodbye, love, I won't remind you

Dream of me as the nights draw cold
Still marking time through winter
You paid the piper and called the tune
And you marched the band away

Take the hand and take a bow
You played for me, that's all for now
Oh, and never mind the words
Just hum along and keep on going

Walk on slowly, don't look behind you
Don't say goodbye, love, I won't remind you
Oh, walk on slowly, don't look behind you
Don't say goodbye, love, I won't remind you, remind you

It's sad to say by it's true
Now I'm a little bit lonesome and just a little bit blue

It doesn't happen too often, to find somebody who knows
Just what a real love feels like and how to make a love grow
I never knew where it went wrong
I only know that it's through
Now I'm a little bit lonesome and just a little bit blue

Yeah I'm a little bit lonesome, but I'm sure that it'll pass
Oh the beat of this blue heart is going to last and last
You said our love was forever
So I was countin' on you
Now I know that I'll never, own anybody that's new
Oh baby I ain't complaining but what you said was untrue
So I'm a little bit lonesome and just a little bit blue

Now I'm a little bit lonesome, but I'm sure that it'll pass

There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the dark nest of strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Deep Blues Sea
My loving woman and me lying in the sand
We’re on a holiday out in a foreign land
Sunny day
We can play
Lazing by the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own

Go underwater and see another world of green
Fishes go by and I get to wondering where they’ve been
Sunny day
We can play
Lazing by the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own

Take out a boat and paddle it around the bay
Pressures from the world seem to fade away
Sunny day
We can play
Sailing on the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own

If you ever lay down at night
And wake up cold and [unverified]
Your baby's gone and left you
She had another man

Why, I'm gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery

Well, when I woke up this mornin'
She was sittin' down before the glass
And when I start to talk
All she would do was laugh

I'm gonna change my ways
I'm gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery

Through your barred windows you look at me

You think you know me but you don't know
That there's more to this picture than that shows
And you fear that I come to steal
Your security that ain't real

All your treasures
All your treasures

I will leave now and you won't cry
With relief now you'll just sigh
You'll remember come one day
And you'll walk out your door
'Cause you can't stay

While all your treasures
All your treasures slip away

All your treasures

D'un Ombre à L'autre
Le Pas Des Balerines
Pour elle le pas des ballerines,
Pour moi le vol noir des corbeaux.
Pour elle le turquoise des piscines,
Pour moi la rouille des barreaux.

J'ai donné dix ans de ma vie,
Pour ses yeux clairs comme de l'eau,
J'ai jamais vu de ballerines,
Sur la paille des cachots.

Chez elle le cuir des limousines,
Et des sourdines aux pianos,
Et chez moi le vacarme des cantines,
Le souffle des bourreaux.

J'ai donné dix ans de ma vie,
Pour ses yeux clairs comme de l'eau,
Pour cette veilleuse qui suit,
Mes doigts sur la photo.

Y'a un homme qui tombe
Les yeux dans la rigole,
Dans la rue principale,
Les lumières qui tournent,
Les jurés me regardent,
Il va falloir que je parle.
La lame est dans ma poche,
Si c'est elle que t'aimes,
Il faut que tu le fasses.
Les lumières s'approchent,
Le cri des sirènes
Mais c'était une impasse.
Et tout le temps que ça dure...
Oh tout le temps que ça dure...

Tout le temps que ça dure.
Les amitiés bizarres
Et les livres pornos.

Dedans, l'eau noire des machines,
Les odeurs de caniveaux,
Et dehors le soleil médecine
Aux crinières des chevaux.
J'ai donné dix ans de ma vie,
Pour ses yeux clairs comme de l'eau,
Elle m'aime encore, elle m'a écrit,
Je change d'air bientôt...

Elle m'aime encore, elle m'a écrit,
Je change d'air bientôt...
Elle m'aime encore...
Oh! elle m'aime encore...
Elle m'aime encore...
Oh! elle m'aime encore...
Elle m'aime encore...

You were at my door
I heard you knocking but I didn't care at all
I had been in all night just staring at the wall
I didn't really want to see you anymore

Coming from the road
You took your coat off and you threw it on the floor
You said "I can't believe you wanna hurt me so"
I said "I'm not supposed to be like this, you know"
Well, I just had to let you go

(Chorus)
What's on your mind?
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind?
Tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

You were in that dream that I was dreaming
I was dreaming in a dream
Your nylon dress and I was floating back downstream
I wanted love to come and swallow everything

Everything gets real
Sooner or later, doesn't matter how you feel
You slammed that door shut on the night of glass and steel
I cannot blame you for believing what you believe
Well, I just had to let you go

(Chorus)

Why do you always stay
Miles away
And two steps behind
Where the past is still living
Beautiful and forgiven
Do you not see
That you live in a dream
Hey

(Chorus) x2

Im Zwiebelsud
Jeden Tag zum Frühstück ißt er
seine essigsaueren Schweinsknöcherl
im Zwiebelsud. In dünnem Rinnsal
läuft Schweiß aus dem Hut,
die Gesichtsseite entlang in den Kragen.

Er benötigte sehr viel, redete
ununterbrochen, oder ließ seinen Zweifeln
und Ängsten vollen Lauf, und hoffte
dabei auf irgendein Wunder, oder
eine Erlösung, indem ihm ein anderer
sagte, was er zu tun hätte,
hoffte auf eine Eingebung anderer,
die bereitwillig ihm soufflierten,
ohne daß sie sich bewußt waren,
dergleichen zu tun.
Zur gleichen Zeit, an einem anderen
Ort:

Die Luft steht still, und eine
Sonne kämpft sich bis zur Erde.
Dumpf und fahl und ohne Ganz.
Die Stirn des Mondes blutet.
Eine handfläche aufgerissen, erhebt
sich ein schmutziges Stück Leben
und reibt an kranker Rinde
Fäulnis ab. Ein Körper ohne Seele
dämmert an braunem Rinnsal dahin.
Ölverklebt der Lippen Gestammel.

Ah, boys, I'm gonna show you the best
Ma Rainey's gonna show you her black bottom

Way down south in Alabamy
I got a friend, they call dancin' Sammy
Who's crazy about all the latest dances
Black bottom stomps and the Jew baby prances

The other night at a swell affair
Soon as the boys found out that I was there
They said, "Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret"
Where that band you ought to hear me say"

I want to see that dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Don't you see the dance you call your big black bottom
That'll put you in a trance

All the boys in the neighborhood
They say your black bottom is really good
Come on and show me your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

I want to see the dance you call the black bottom
I want to learn that dance
Come on and show that dance you call your big black bottom
It puts you in a trance

Early last morning 'bout the break of day
Grandpa told my grandma, I heard him say
Get up and show your old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom
They stay to see that dance
Wait until you see me do my big black bottom
I'll put you in a trance

Ah, do it ma, do it, honey
Look it now Ma, you gettin' kinda rough here
You gotta be yourself now, careful now
Not too strong, not too strong, Ma

I done shown y'all my black bottom
You ought to learn that dance

Dust you down from tip to toe
Show you how the garden grows

Hold you steady as you go
Join the chorus if you can
It'll make of you an honest man

Let me bring you love from the field
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again

As you drag down every lovers' lane
Life's long celebration's here
I'll toast you all in penny cheer

Let me bring you all things refined
Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale
Greeting well-met fellow, hail
I am the wind to fill your sail

I am the cross to take your nail
A singer of these ageless times
With kitchen prose and gutter rhymes

Songs from the wood make you feel much better
Songs from the wood make you feel much better

Songs from the wood
Songs from the wood

Let me bring you love from the field
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again

Honey bee
Come buzzing me
I ain't seen you for so long

I need to feel you
I mean to reel you
Like the one described to me in song

Out in the woods
Tall pine tree woods
She gave sweet loving to me

Her woodland grace
Her soft embrace
My face in shadow
Honey bee

Won't you come see me in the morning?
Won't you come see me late at night?
For it ain't right, no it just ain't right
You're meant to turn away from the light

Night, all my lights are on
I need a little one on one
This useless, helpless feeling

A young man should be blessed with love
There's just flesh and fire below
This drunken, senseless reeling
Hands on my face
Some silk and lace
Sweet perfume kisses
For me

Wherever you burn
I have returned
You lucky lady
Honey bee

I have to leave you in the morning
You always wanted to be free

Stay with me
Sweet lucky lady
Don't ever leave me
Honey bee

Awake in cold places
Cool ice and icy faces
Some dead and some living
Most of them doing something in between

My lady in waiting
Must have turned to hating me
Some bitter awakening this has been
The next time she calls I'm gonna let her in
The next time she calls I'm gonna let her in

And if she leaves me in the morning
At least we both have been relieved

Now stay with me
Stay with me
Sweet lucky lady
Don't you ever leave me
Honey bee
