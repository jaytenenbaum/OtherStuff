Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East, and the 15th most populated in the world. The great majority of its over 84 million people    live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about  , where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara Desert, which constitute most of Egypts territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypts residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.

The economy of Egypt is one of the most diversified in the Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and services at almost equal production levels. Egypt is considered to be a middle power,  with significant cultural, political, and military influence in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Muslim world.

===Egypt Eyalet===
 
 
Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman invasion pushed the Egyptian system into decline. The defensive militarization damaged its civil society and economic institutions.  The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade.  Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and 1731.  The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.

In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when Syria seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen (formerly the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), known as the United Arab States. In 1959, the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.

Elections observers also alleged government interference in the election process.  After the election, Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour, the runner-up. 

HRWs 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations, including routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.    In 2007, Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international center for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the War on Terror.  Egypts foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report. 

Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity, allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law, authorized broad police powers of arrest and surveillance, gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring.  In 2009, Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki, Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party (Egypt)|NDP, described Egypt as a "pharaonic" political system, and democracy as a "long term goal". Dessouki also stated that "the real center of power in Egypt is the military".

On 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubaraks government. On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Jubilant celebrations broke out in Tahrir Square at the news.  The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern.   Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state.

==Geography==
 
 
Egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22nd parallel north|22 and 32nd parallel north|32N, and longitudes 25th meridian east|25 and 35th meridian east|35E. At  ,  it is the worlds 30th-largest country. Nevertheless, due to the aridity of Egypts climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses only about 5.5% of the total land area.  98% of Egyptians live on 3% of the territory.   

Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. Egypts important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a transcontinental nation, it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between Africa and Asia, traversed by a navigable waterway (the Suez Canal) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea.
 oases scattered sand dunes that peak at more than   high. Egypt includes parts of the Sahara Desert and of the Libyan Desert. These deserts that protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt.
 Oases include el Dakhla, el Kharga and Siwa Oasis|Siwa. Protectorates include Ras Mohamed National Park, Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa.

See Egyptian Protectorates for more information.

===Climate===
 
 
Most of Egypts rain falls in the winter months.  South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around   per year and at intervals of many years. On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as  ,  mostly between October and March. Snow falls on Sinais mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim, Sidi Barrany, etc. and rarely in Alexandria. Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.

Temperatures average between   in summer, and up to   on the Red Sea coast. Winter temperatures average between  . A steady wind from the northwest helps lower temperatures near the Mediterranean coast. The Khamaseen is a wind that blows from the south in spring, bringing sand and dust, and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than  .

Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam, the Nile flooded annually (colloquially The Gift of the Nile) replenishing Egypts soil. This gave the country consistent harvest throughout the years.

The potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten Egypts densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the countrys economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the century, according to some climate experts.  

===Biodiversity=== National Biodiversity CBD Biodiversity National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants,  Egypts plan was unusual in providing balanced information about all forms of life.

The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt: algae (1483 species), animals (about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects), fungi (more than 627 species), monera (319 species), plants (2426 species), protozoans (371 species). For some major groups, for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms, the number was not known. Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles, the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt. For the fungi, including lichen-forming species, for example, subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt, and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher.

 Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood is present in small segments  of the lower-middle strata of Egyptian society. 

Egypt has the oldest continuous parliamentary tradition in the Arab world.  The first popular assembly was established in 1866. It was disbanded by the British occupation of 1882, and the British allowed only a consultative body to sit. In 1923, however, after the countrys independence was declared, a new constitution provided for a parliamentary monarchy.

According to the Israeli chair of the former Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yuval Steinitz, the Egyptian Air Force has roughly the same number of modern warplanes as the Israeli Air Force and far more Western tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft batteries and warships than the Israel Defense Forces|IDF.  Egypt is speculated by Israel to be the second country in the region with a spy satellite, EgyptSat 1. 

The United States of America provides an annual military assistance, which in 2009 amounted to US$ 1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$  }} billion in  ).   

The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods, and it exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors. 

===Human rights===
 
 
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights is one of the longest-standing bodies for the defence of human rights in Egypt.  In 2003, the Government established the National Council for Human Rights.  The council came under heavy criticism by local activists, who contend it was a propaganda tool for the Government to excuse its violations  and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law.

In the 21st century, Egypt has had a major problem with immigration, as millions of Africans flee poverty and war. Border control methods can be "harsh, sometimes lethal." 

==Administrative divisions==
 
 
Egypt is divided into 27 governorates. The governorates are further divided into regions. The regions contain towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital, sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate.

==Economy==
 
 
Egypts economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, exports of natural gas, and tourism; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and Europe. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population, limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy. 

The government has invested in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has received U.S. foreign aid (since 1979, an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Its main revenues however come from tourism as well as traffic that goes through the Suez Canal.

An estimated 2.7 million Egyptians abroad contribute actively to the development of their country through remittances (US$ 7.8 billion in 2009), as well as circulation of human and social capital and investment. 

Egyptian society is moderately unequal in terms of income distribution, with an estimated "35 to 40%" of Egypts population earning less than the equivalent of $2 a day, while only around 23% may be considered wealthy. 

===Tourism===
 
 
 ]]
Tourism is one of the most important sectors in Egypts economy. More than 12.8 million tourists visited Egypt in 2008, providing revenues of nearly $11 billion. The sector employs about 12% of Egypts workforce. 

===Transport===
 
Transport in Egypt is centered in Cairo and largely follow the pattern of settlement along the Nile. The main line of the nations 40,800-kilometer (25,400&nbsp;mi) railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways. The badly maintained road network has expanded rapidly to over 21,000 miles, covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases.

The Cairo Metro in Egypt is the first of only two full-fledged metro systems in Africa, and the Arab World. The system consists of three operational lines.
