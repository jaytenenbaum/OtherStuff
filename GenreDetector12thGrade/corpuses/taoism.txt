==Spelling and pronunciation==
 
 , one of the holiest mountains in China]]
 Chinese word   "way, path" is romanized tao in the older WadeGiles system and Tao|do in the modern Pinyin system. In linguistic terminology, English Taoism/Daoism is formed from the Chinese loanword tao/dao   "way; route; principle" and the native suffix -ism. The debate over Taoism vs. Daoism involves sinology, phonemes, loanwords, and politics&nbsp; not to mention whether Taoism should be pronounced   or  .

Daoism is pronounced  , but English speakers disagree whether Taoism should be   or  . In theory, both WadeGiles tao and Pinyin dao are articulated identically, as are Taoism and Daoism. An investment book titled The Tao Jones Averages (a pun on the Dow Jones Indexes) illustrates this   pronunciations widespread familiarity.  In speech, Tao and Taoism are often pronounced   and  , reading the Chinese unaspirated lenis ("weak")   as the English voiceless stop consonant  . Lexicography shows American and British English differences in pronouncing Taoism. A study of major English dictionaries published in Great Britain and the United States found the most common Taoism glosses were   in British sources and   in American ones. 

==Categorization==
There is debate over how, and whether, Taoism should be categorized. Traditionally, it is divided into two categories: 
# Philosophical Taoism (Daojia,  ; lit. "school of Dao")  The philosophy based on the texts of the Daodejing ( ) and the Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi ( ). These texts were linked together under the term of Daojia during the early Han Dynasty, but notably not before.   It is unlikely that Zhuangzi was familiar with the text of the Daodejing,  Graham (1989) p. 170171  and Zhuangzi would not have identified himself as a Taoist as this classification did not arise until well after his death. 
# Religious Taoism (Daojiao,  ; lit. "teachings of Dao")  A family of organized religious movements sharing concepts or terminology derived from Daojia;  the first of these is recognized as the Celestial Masters school.

However, the distinction between Daojia and Daojiao is rejected by the majority of modern scholars (at least in Japan and the West).    It is, among others, contested by hermeneutic (interpretive) difficulties in the categorization of the different Taoist schools, sects and movements.  Taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single organized religion like the Abrahamic traditions; nor can it be studied as the originator or a variant of Chinese folk religion, as although the two share some similar concepts, much of Chinese folk religion is outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. Robinet (1997), p. 103.  Sinologists Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn agree that "Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations." 

==Origins and development==
 
 ]]
Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated in this context with "original", or "primordial", Taoism.  Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed; Robinet 1997, p. 25   however, the work attributed to him  the Daodejing  is dated to the late 4th century BC. 

Taoism draws its cosmological foundations from the School of Naturalists (in form of its main elements  yin and yang and the Five Phases), which developed during the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BC). Robinet 1997, p. 6 

Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism: Philosophical Taoism, i.e. the Daodejing and Zhuangzi
#techniques for achieving ecstasy
#practices for achieving longevity or immortality
#exorcism. 

Some elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition.   In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the wu (connected to the "shamanism" of Southern China) and the fangshi (which probably derived from the "archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case. Robinet 1997, p. 36  Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to "...&nbsp;magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings" as well as exorcism; in the case of the wu, "shamans" or "sorcerers" is often used as a translation.  The fangshi were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists, and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities. 
 Tianshi (Celestial Zhengyi school), developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142.  The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Caos rise to power in return.  Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE. 
 Shangqing school, gained official status in China again during the Tang Dynasty (618907), whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.  The Shangqing movement, however, had developed much earlier, in the 4th century, on the basis of a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi in the years between 364 to 370. 
 Lingbao school,  which unfolded its greatest influence during the Song Dynasty (9601279).  Several Song emperors, most notably Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the Daozang. 

In the 12th century, the Quanzhen School was founded in Shandong. It flourished during the 13th and 14th century and during the Yuan dynasty became the largest and most important Taoist school in Northern China. The schools most revered master, Qiu Chuji, met with Genghis Khan in 1222 and was successful in influencing the Khan towards exerting more restraint during his brutal conquests. By the Khans decree, the school also was exempt from taxation. 
 Ming (13681644).  The Qing Dynasty (16441912), however, much favored Confucian classics over Taoist works. During the 18th century, the imperial library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.   By the beginning of the 20th century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (for example, only one complete copy of the Daozang still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing). 

Today, Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the Peoples Republic of China. The government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association.  Taoism is freely practiced in Religion in Taiwan|Taiwan, where it claims millions of adherents.

==Ethics== Lion guardians]] detachment from desires, and most important of all, wu wei.  However, the concepts of those keystone texts can not be equated with Taoism as a whole. 

===Tao and Te===
 
Tao ( ) literally means "way", but can also be interpreted as road, channel, path, doctrine, or line.  In Taoism, it is "the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course."  It has variously been denoted as the "flow of the universe",  a "conceptually necessary ontological ground",  or a demonstration of nature. Martinson (1987), pp. 168169.  The Tao also is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves. 

The active expression of Tao is called Te (also spelled  and pronounced  De, or even Teh; often translated with Virtue or Power;  ),  in a sense that Te results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao. 

===Wu-wei===
 
The ambiguous term wu-wei ( ) constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism.  Wei refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while wu carries the meaning of "there is no ..." or "lacking, without". Common translations are "nonaction", "effortless action" or "action without intent".  The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradox expression "wei wu wei": "action without action". 

In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature.  Taoist philosophy proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world, they disrupt that harmony. Taoism does not identify ones will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe. Faching & deChant (2001), p. 35.  Thus, a potentially harmful interference is to be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly.   "By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction." 

===Naturalness===
Naturalness ( ; lit. "self-such") is regarded as a central value in Taoism.  It describes the "primordial state" of all things  as well as a basic character of the Tao , and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity.   To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao ; this involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire, and appreciating simplicity. 

An often cited metaphor for naturalness is pu ( ; lit. "uncut wood"), the "uncarved block", which represents the "original nature... prior to the imprint of culture" of an individual.  It is usually referred to as a state one returns to. 

===Three Treasures===
 , February 2006]]
 
The Three Treasures or Three Jewels ( ) are basic virtues in Taoism comprising Compassion, Moderation, and Humility. They are also translated as kindness, simplicity (or the absence of excess), and modesty. Arthur Waley describes them as " he three rules that formed the practical, political side of the authors teaching". He correlated the Three Treasures with "abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment", "absolute simplicity of living", and "refusal to assert active authority". 

==Cosmology==
 

Taoist cosmology is based on the beliefs of the School of Naturalists.  In this spirit, the universe is seen as being in a constant process of re-creating itself, as everything that exists is a mere aspect of qi, which, "condensed, becomes life; diluted, it is indefinite potential".  Qi is in a perpetual transformation between its condensed and diluted state. Robinet (1997), p. 8  These two different states of qi, on the other hand, are embodiments of the abstract entities of yin and yang,  two complementary extremes that constantly play against and with each other and cannot exist without the other. 
 microcosm of Five Elements in form of the zang-fu organs.  As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself. 

==Physical exercises==
 
A recurrent and important element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending ones life, ideally to the point of immortality.   Probably the most characteristic among these methods is Taoist alchemy. Already in very early Taoist scriptures - like the Taiping Jing and the Baopuzi - alchemical formulas for achieving immortality were outlined.  
Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as Xian (Taoism)|xian. 
 Xing Yi Quan) embody Taoist principles to a significant extent, and some practitioners consider their art to be a means of practicing Taoism. 

==Pantheon==
 
 
 
Taoist beliefs include teachings based on various sources. Therefore, different branches of Taoism often have differing beliefs, especially concerning deities and the proper composition of the pantheon.   Nevertheless, there are certain core beliefs that nearly all the sects share. 
 Celestial Masters Imperial China; deities also may be promoted or demoted for their actions. 

While a number of immortals or other mysterious figures appear in the Zhuangzi, and to a lesser extent in the Tao Te Ching, these have generally not become the objects of worship. Traditional conceptions of Tao are not to be confused with the Western concepts of theism. Being one with the Tao does not indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu sense.  

==Texts==

===Tao Te Ching===
  depicted as a Taoist teacher]]
  Guodian bamboo slips - date back to the late 4th century BC.    Throughout the history of religious Taoism, the Tao Te Ching has been used as a ritual text. 

The famous opening lines of the Tao Te Ching are:   ( ) 
"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao" 
 ( ) 
"The name that can be named is not the eternal name."  
There is significant, at times acrimonious debate regarding which English translation of the Tao Te Ching is to be preferred, and which particular translation methodology is best.  The Tao Te Ching is not thematically ordered. However, the main themes of the text are repeatedly expressed using variant formulations, often with only a slight difference.  The leading themes revolve around the nature of Tao and how to attain it. Tao is said to be ineffable, and accomplishing great things through small means. Van Voorst (2005), p. 165  Ancient commentaries on the Tao Te Ching are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the Heshang Gong commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE.  Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xianger. 

===Zhuangzi===
  chapters (the "inner chapters") and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the "outer" and "miscellaneous" chapters). The work uses anecdotes, parables and dialogues to express one of its main themes, that is aligning oneself to the laws of the natural world and "the way" of the elements.  

===Daozang===
  Song dynasties. The version surviving today was published during the Ming Dynasty.   The Ming Daozang includes almost 1500 sacred text|texts.  Following the example of the Buddhist Tripiaka, it is divided into three dong ( , "caves", "grottoes"). They are arranged from "highest" to "lowest":  
 Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures.
# The Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen ("divine"  ) grotto. Includes texts predating the Maoshan   revelations.

Daoshi generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose, or inherit, texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student. 

The Shangqing school has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality. 

===Other texts===
  Taishang Ganying Pian ("Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution") discusses sin and ethics, and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries.  It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.
