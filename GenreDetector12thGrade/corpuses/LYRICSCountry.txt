Florida Georgia Line - Cruise Lyrics
Artist: Florida Georgia Line
Album: Here's To The Good Times
Listen while you read!
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Hey baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sippin’ on southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin’
Hell I can’t get you out of my head

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yea











Blake Shelton - Boys 'Round Here Lyrics
Artist: Blake Shelton
Album: Based on a True Story
Listen while you read!
[Featuring: Pistol Annies]

Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night; what? (That's right)
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your 4 wheel drive (A country boy can survive)

Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck

Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?) No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Let me hear you say
(Ooh let's ride)
(Ooh let's ride)
Down to the river side

(Ooh let's ride…)
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town
Have you ever got down with a…
Red red red red red red redneck?
And do you wanna get down with a…
Red red red red red red redneck?
Girl you gotta get down

With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

(Ooh let's ride)
Red red red red red red redneck
(Ooh let's ride)
I'm one of them boys 'round here
(Ooh let's ride)
Red red red red red red redneck
(Ooh let's ride)

(Ooh let's ride…)
Well all I'm thinkin' 'bout is you and me, how we'll be
So come on girl, hop inside
Me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town
Girl you gotta get down with a…
Come on through the country side
Down to the river side












Darius Rucker - Wagon Wheel Lyrics
Artist: Darius Rucker
Album: True Believers
Listen while you read!
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
I lost my money playing poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me



















Tim McGraw - Highway Don't Care Lyrics
Artist: Tim McGraw
Album: Two Lanes of Freedom
Listen while you read!
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do.
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do.

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me.
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you baby, oh baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do.
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do.

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do.

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
(The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do)























Luke Bryan - Crash My Party (Single) Lyrics
Artist: Luke Bryan
Album: Crash My Party (Single)
Listen while you read!
It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”.
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night

Girl, I don’t care. Oh I just gotta see what you’re wearing.
Your hair, is I put up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me you don’t have to worry ‘bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that’s alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me.
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two.

[Chorus]

If it’s 2 in the morning and you’re feeling lonely and wondering what I’m doing.

[Chorus]
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me you don’t have to worry ‘bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that’s alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

Baby you can crash my party anytime.

Genre: Country
Listen while you read!
[Encore edition bonus track:]


I'm booking myself a one way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you baby is a waste of time

Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
Got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

But I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me baby? Let's be crazy

I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does

I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catchin' up calls and a date sometimes
A love that revels and stills believes
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah

Oh, I know we're crazy, yeah

But I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy
You with me baby? Let's be crazy

No! I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss, it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about,
I've searched the world and I know now,
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yea I don't want easy, I want crazy

Yeah, look at us baby, tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough, maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love…
Let's be crazy!

Who cares if we're crazy, we gotta be crazy
I know that we're crazy, so let's be crazy
Yeah…
































Strawberry shimmer on hot lips,
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips.
I sparkle when she smiles.
Shine down on the radio dial.
Homemade jar, lemmon drop, take a sip.
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your ... shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky dripped in rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!

Baby get your shine on!

Silverado, candy painted,
Ray Ban's got the whole world shaded.
Chrome piece tucked in the console,
Riding high, roll up on the down low.
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky, clear.
So slide that little sugar shaker over here...
And get your shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky dripped in rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!

Baby get your shine on!

Homemade jar,
Lemon drop take a sip.
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your... shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky dripped in rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!

Baby get your shine on!

Cause you and me be rocking all night long!

Summer sky dripped in rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!

Baby get your shine on!

Strawberry shimmer on her lips,
Silver buckle hanging off her hips.
I sparkle when she smiles,
Shine down on the radio dial.
Silverado, candy painted,
Ray Ban's got the whole world shaded.
Chromed piece tucked in the console.
Riding high, roll up on the down low.



























George Strait - Give it All We Got Tonight Lyrics
Artist: George Strait
Album: Love Is Everything
Listen while you read!
July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream

Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
'Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
'Cause that's all we have in this life
Baby, drink up this love, give it all we got tonight
Give it all we got tonight

Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
That's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, c'mon, give it all we got tonight
Give it all we got tonight


































Miranda Lambert - Mama's Broken Heart Lyrics
Artist: Miranda Lambert
Album: Four The Record
Genre: Country
Listen while you read!
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
I don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin', she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip and save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your I's
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart


























Lady Antebellum - Downtown Lyrics
Artist: Lady Antebellum
Album: Golden
Listen while you read!
Well, all the parties on the streets are talking, store front mannequins sleeping in lights.
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking like it was your birthday every other saturday night.
Knew The bands so we never payed our cover.
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles.
We never dressed to impress all the others,
They would let us in on our laid back kind of style.
But boy you know it's been a while.

I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhhhhhhh anymore.

I got some platforms sitting in the corner.
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk.
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh but you ain't gettin' uh uh if you don't come pick me up (damn),
Show me off (wow),
You might be tired, but I'm not!

And I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.

I don't know why you don't take me downtown like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be countin on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhh anymore.
Yeaaaaah I don't know why you don't take me downtown,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
I just don't get it

You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far to long because I never gave up the fight
Until now

Gonna put through you a world of hurt
Oh I don't believe in getting even but giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice

I don't wanna be your just for fun,
Don't wanna be under your thumb

Keith Urban - Little Bit of Everything Lyrics
Artist: Keith Urban
Album: Little Bit of Everything (Single)
I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it'd be good for me
I want a cool chick that'll cook for me
But'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want and she'll do it with me

I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

Now I don't need a garage full of cars
But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I'll smoke 'em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don't need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ole room
Still feels lonely when it's just you
Yes it does

I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
I'll be OK with what I've done
Still having fun

Cause I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Yeah yea yea
Whoa, whoa, oh yeah

Don't you worry 'bout getting fixed up
When you wake up you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck
So come on baby don't ya keep me waitin'
I gotta go I got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

Woah oh oh
Girl every now and then you get a night like this
Woah oh oh
This is one that we don't want to miss no

-chorus- 
So come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside lover song
Hey baby all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight

Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Out of the blue pullin' into your drive
Wonderin' why I got ya way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear

Woah oh oh
Girl you never looked better than you do right now 
Woah oh oh
Aw heaven let your light shine down

-chorus-

Woah oh oh
Girl every now and then you get a night like this 
Woah oh oh

All I wanna do is hold ya tight
Come on come on come on we're runnin' outta moonlight
Woah oh oh

Woah oh oh


































Kenny Chesney - Pirate Flag Lyrics
Artist: Kenny Chesney
Album: Life on a Rock
Listen while you read!
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town,
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around.
Moonshine, that's where they make it,
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked.
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line.
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able
Don't know what makes you say "What the hell"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just wanna dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
Pirate flag and an island girl

Well I remember back home 'neath the big ol' moon
Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinkin' shooting stars

I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

Now girl I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere

Now let's get outta this town, outta this club
Girl whatever you're sippin' I'ma mix it up
Take a few tick-tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop
I got that

I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your Pick-Up Man

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie

How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose
'Bout to bust out my honky-tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Will the real Joe Diffie please stand up































Kip Moore - Hey Pretty Girl Lyrics
Artist: Kip Moore
Album: Up All Night
Listen while you read!
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Love's in the air tonight
Bet you could make this ol' boy stay
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make your mind there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this chance

Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right

Life's a lonely, winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
Happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than anything

Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home
My momma's gonna love you
She'll make me sleep on the couch, I know
But hey pretty girl, wanna take you home

Hey pretty girl, lets build some dreams
A house on a piece of land
Plant some roots and some apple trees
Hey pretty girl, lets build some dreams

Life's a lonely, winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
Happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than anything

Hey pretty girl, you did so good
Our baby's got your eyes
And a fighters heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl, you did so good

Hey pretty girl when I see the light
When it's my time to go
I'm gonna thank the Lord for a real good life
Pretty little girl and a beautiful wife






























Thomas Rhett - It Goes Like This Lyrics
Artist: Thomas Rhett
Album: It Goes Like This (Single)
Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song,
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long,
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead.
Yea girl, you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away,
Yea it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yea it goes like this.

Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home,
Get you outta here and get you all alone.
I don't know what it is about you, baby,
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy,
But you make me wanna write a song.

And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do,
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away,
Yea it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yea it goes like this.

Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way,
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

Something like ooh, what I wouldn't do,
To write my name on my heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away,
Yea it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yea it goes like this

And it goes like ooh, and it goes like hey,
And it ends with a kiss,
Yea it goes like this.


































Blake Shelton - Sure Be Cool If You Did Lyrics
Artist: Blake Shelton
Album: Based on a True Story
Listen while you read!
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

You can't shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road just as far as you wanna go
Baby, I'll do, whatever you wanna do, wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
Yeah, it'd sure be cool if you did






























Jake Owen - Anywhere With You Lyrics
Artist: Jake Owen
Album: Barefoot Blue Jean Night
Genre: Country
Listen while you read!
If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then, baby, that's where we'll go

If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

I'll go anywhere, West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair, have you ever seen California?
Pick a spot on any old map,
I travel light and my bags are packed

Just as long as I'm where you're at, I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out

Well, we could send a post card back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime, baby, you say when

I'll go anywhere, West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair, have you ever seen California?
Pick a spot on any old map,
I travel light and my bags are packed

Just as long as I'm where you're at, I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

Yeah, I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby, I don't care
Mexico on wild hair
Have you ever seen California?

Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view

I'll go anywhere, girl, I'll swear
Just say the word I'll take you there
Anywhere, anywhere with you
Yeah, I'll go anywhere with you




















Brad Paisley - Beat This Summer Lyrics
Artist: Brad Paisley
Album: Wheelhouse
Listen while you read!
Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ho

Like the first wheel goes around and around
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
You won't find a tan line anywhere

Baby I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end…

As long I live, whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Yeah looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby I can tell

As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
