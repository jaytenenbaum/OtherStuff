==Etymology==
The name Paris derives from that of its earliest inhabitants, the Gaulish tribe known as the Parisii (France)|Parisii. The city was called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, "Lutetia of the Parisii"), during the Roman era of the 1st to the 4th century AD, but during the reign of Julian the Apostate (360–363), the city was renamed Paris.    It is believed that the name of the Parisii tribe comes from the Celtic Gallic word parisio meaning "the working people" or "the craftsmen".     
 Baron Haussmann, drastic transformation of Paris into a modern city, tore down whole quartiers of houses and narrow streets dating back to the Middle Ages, and opened large avenues which let light (lumière) come into the former medieval city. 

Since the mid-19th century, Paris has been known as Paname    ( ) in the Parisian   , i.e. "Im from Paname"). The singer Renaud repopularized the term among the young generation  with his 1976 album Amoureux de Paname ("In love with Paname").

Paris inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" and in French as Parisiens ( ) and Parisiennes. Parisians are often pejoratively called Parigots ( ) and Parigotes, a term first used in 1900  by those living outside the Paris region .

==History==
  Latin Quarter]]

===Origins=== Romans conquered Left Bank Sainte Geneviève Hill and the Île de la Cité. The Gallo-Roman town was originally called Lutetia, or Lutetia Parisorum but later Gallicised to Lutèce. It expanded greatly over the following centuries, becoming a prosperous city with a forum, palaces, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.   
&nbsp; Germanic invasions sent the city into a period of decline. By AD&nbsp;400, Lutèce, largely abandoned by its inhabitants, was little more than a garrison town entrenched into a hastily fortified central island.  The city reclaimed its original appellation of "Paris" towards the end of the Roman occupation, around 360&nbsp;AD. 

===Merovingian and Feudal eras===
  dynasty]] Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508 and was responsible for converting the city back to Christianity. City Guide, p. 27  The late 8th century Carolingian dynasty displaced the Frankish capital to Aachen; this period coincided with the beginning of Viking invasions that had spread as far as Paris by the early 9th century.

In August 1572, under the reign of Charles IX of France|Charles&nbsp;IX, while many noble Protestants were in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of Henri of Navarre – the future Henry IV of France|Henri&nbsp;IV – to Margaret of Valois, sister of Charles IX, the St.&nbsp;Bartholomews Day massacre occurred; beginning on 24&nbsp;August, it lasted several days and spread throughout the country.  
 Siege of Paris, but, threatened with usurption from Philip II of Spain, he converted to Catholicism in 1594, and the city welcomed him as king.  The Bourbons, Henris family, spend vast amounts of money keeping the city under control, building the Ile St-Louis as well as bridges and other infrastructure.  However, unhappy with their lack of political representation, in 1648 Parisians rose in a rebellion known as the Fronde and the royal family fled the city. King Louis XIV of France|Louis&nbsp;XIV later moved the royal court permanently to Palace of Versailles|Versailles, a lavish estate on the outskirts of Paris,  in 1682. The following century was an "Age of Enlightenment" – Paris reputation grew on the writings of its intellectuals such as the philosopher Voltaire, and Denis Diderot|Diderot, the first volume of his Encyclopédie being published in Paris in 1751.

 Second Empire levelled entire districts of Paris narrow, winding medieval streets to create the network of wide avenues and neo-classical façades that still make up much of modern Paris; the reason for this transformation was twofold, as not only did the creation of wide boulevards beautify and sanitize the capital, it also facilitated the effectiveness of troops and artillery against any further uprisings and barricades for which Paris was so famous.

 Rimbaud and Pissarro were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and after was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad."

Central Paris endured World War&nbsp;II practically unscathed, as there were no strategic targets for Allied bombers (train stations in central Paris are terminal stations; major factories were located in the suburbs), and despite orders to destroy the city and all historic monuments the German commander Dietrich von Choltitz refused, gaining the popular title "Saviour of Paris" for his defiance of the Führer. 

In the post-war era, Paris experienced its largest development since the end of the Belle Époque in 1914. The suburbs began to expand considerably, with the construction of large social estates known as cités and the beginning of La Défense, the business district. A comprehensive express subway network, the RER, was built to complement the Métro and serve the distant suburbs, while a network of freeways was developed in the suburbs, centred on the Périphérique (Paris)|Périphérique expressway encircling the city.

A massive urban renewal project, the Grand Paris (Greater Paris), was launched in 2007 by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.     It consists of various economic, cultural, housing, transport and environmental projects to reach a better integration of the territories and revitalise the metropolitan economy. The most emblematic project is the €26.5 billion construction by 2030 of a new automatic metro, which will consist of   of rapid-transit lines connecting the Grand Paris regions to one another and to the centre of Paris.   
Nevertheless, the Paris metropolitan area is still divided into numerous territorial collectivities and their fusion into a more integrated metropolis government, although sometimes discussed  is not on the agenda.  An ad-hoc structure, Paris Métropole, has however been established in June 2009 to coordinate the action of 184 "Parisian" territorial collectivities. 
 several skyscrapers   and higher have been approved since 2006 in the business district of La Défense, to the west of the city proper, and are scheduled to be completed by the early 2010s. Paris authorities also stated publicly that they are planning to authorise the construction of skyscrapers within the city proper by relaxing the cap on building height for the first time since the construction of the Tour Montparnasse in the early 1970s.

==Cityscape==
 
 

===Architecture===
 
  (1897)]]
  Notre Dame cathedral and the church of Sainte-Chapelle are two of the most striking buildings in the city.  Much of contemporary Paris is the result of the vast Haussmanns renovation of Paris|mid-19th century urban remodelling. For centuries, the city had been a labyrinth of narrow streets and half-timber houses, but, beginning with Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Haussmans advent, entire quarters were levelled to make way for wide avenues lined with neo-classical stone buildings of bourgeoisie standing. Most of this "new" Paris is the Paris seen today. City Guide, p. 48  The following half-century was a blossoming of architectural inspiration; the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur was a combination of Romanesque and neo-Byzantine design paradigms built in 1871 as an appeasement against the "sins" of the atheist communards and as an offering in thanks for the lifting of the Prussian siege.  Paris most famous architecture, the Eiffel Tower, was built as a temporary exhibit for the 1889 World Fair and remains an enduring symbol of the capital with its iconic structure and position towering over much of the city. 
 Second Empire plans are in many cases still followed. The "alignement" law is still in place, which regulates building façades of new constructions according to a pre-defined street width. A buildings height is limited according to the width of the streets it borders, and under the regulation, it is almost impossible to get an approval to build a taller building. 

Many of Paris important institutions are located outside the city limits. The financial (La Défense) business district; the main food wholesale market (Marché dIntérêt National de Rungis|Rungis); schools (École Polytechnique; École supérieure des sciences économiques et commerciales|ESSEC; INSEAD; HEC School of Management|HEC);  research laboratories (in Saclay or Évry, Essonne|Évry); the largest stadium (the Stade de France), and the government offices (Ministry of Transportation) are located in the citys suburbs.

===Districts and historical centres===
 

====City of Paris====
* Place de la Bastille (4th, 11th and 12th arrondissements, right bank) is a district of great historical significance, for not just Paris, but also all of France. Because of its symbolic value, the square has often been a site of political demonstrations, and it has a tall column commemorating the final resting place of the revolutionaries killed in 1830 and 1848. 

*  . Nearby Place Vendôme is famous for its fashionable and deluxe hotels (Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz and Hôtel de Vendôme) and its jewellers; it is famous both as the place of Princess Dianas last meal, and as the setting of the gangster classic Le Cercle Rouge. 

* Champs-Élysées (8th arrondissement, right bank) is a 17th-century garden-promenade-turned-avenue connecting Place de la Concorde and Arc de Triomphe. It is one of the many tourist attractions and a major shopping street of Paris, hosting labels such as Sephora, Lancel, Louis Vuitton and Guerlain, as well as other brands like Renault, Toyota and numerous small souvenir outlets; restored with the equivalent of €75 million under the governance of Jaques Chirac it has become perhaps the most well-known street in France. 
 metro connection station (Châtelet – Les Halles, the biggest in the world). The old Halles were destroyed in 1971 and replaced by the Forum des Halles. The central market of Paris, the biggest wholesale food market in the world, was transferred to Marché dIntérêt National de Rungis|Rungis, in the southern suburbs.

*Le Marais (3rd and 4th arrondissements) is a trendy Right Bank district. It is architecturally very well preserved, and some of the oldest houses and buildings of Paris can be found there. It is a very culturally open place, known for its Chinese, Jewish and gay communities.

===Water and sanitation===

 ]] aqueduct from southerly Wissous (later left to ruin); sources from the Right bank hills from the late 11th century; from the 15th century, an aqueduct built roughly along the path of the abandoned Wissous aqueduct; also, from 1809, the canal de lOurcq, providing Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the northeast of the Capital (political)|capital, and "Gods Tears", a bi-annual rainstorm, which stopped in the early 20th century as a natural phenomenon. Paris would have its first constant and plentiful source of drinkable water only from the late 19th century.

From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&nbsp;IIIs Préfet Baron Haussmann|Haussmann, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capitals highest points of elevation. From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris streets. This system is still a major part of Paris modern water-supply network.

Paris has over   of underground passageways    dedicated to the evacuation of Paris liquid wastes. Most of these date from the late 19th century, a result of the combined plans of the Préfet Baron Haussmann and the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand to improve the then-very unsanitary conditions in the Capital. Maintained by a 24/7|round-the-clockservice since their construction, only a small percentage of Paris sewer réseau has needed complete renovation. 

In 1982, then mayor Jacques Chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets.  The project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law which now fines dog owners up to 500 euros for not removing their dog faeces. It was estimated at the time of their removal, that the fleet of 70 Motocrottes were cleaning up only 20% of dog faeces on Parisian street – at an annual cost of £3 million. 

The air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (pm10), is the highest in France, with 38&nbsp;µg/m³. 

===Cemeteries===
  hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.]]
Paris main cemetery was located to its outskirts on its Left Bank from the beginning of its history,  but this changed with the rise of Catholicism and the construction of churches towards the city-centre, many of them having adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. Generations of a growing city population soon filled these cemeteries to overflowing, creating sometimes very unsanitary conditions.
 14th arrondissements Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city tax wall called the Wall of the Farmers-General. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise, Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre, Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse, and later Passy Cemetery|Passy.

When Paris annexed all communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860, its cemeteries were once again within its city walls. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière Parisien de Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière Parisien de Bobigny-Pantin, the Cimetière Parisien dIvry-sur-Seine|Ivry, and the Cimetière Parisien de Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux.

Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, such as Rock en Seine. 

Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the worlds global cities, that is to say with a dominance of Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (réalisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated. A specialty of Paris is its very large network of small cinemas. In a given week, the movie fan has the choice between around 300 old or new movies from all over the world.

Many of Paris concert/dance halls were transformed into movie theatres when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms: Paris largest cinema today is by far le Grand Rex theatre with 2,800 seats, whereas other cinemas all have fewer than 1,000 seats. There is now a trend toward modern multiplexes that contain more than 10 or 20 screens.
 Antoine Lumière realized, on 28 December 1895, the first projection, with the Cinematograph, in Paris.  Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris. 

===Cuisine===

Paris culinary reputation has its base in the diverse origins of its inhabitants. In its beginnings, it owed much to the 19th-century organisation of a railway system that had Paris as a centre, making the capital a focal point for immigration from Frances many different regions and gastronomical cultures. This reputation continues through today in a cultural diversity that has since spread to a worldwide level thanks to Paris continued reputation for culinary finesse and further immigration from increasingly distant climes. Paris and Île-de-France are central regions where almost anything from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine can be had here. High-quality Michelin Guide rated restaurants proliferate here.   
 Expositions Universelles (Worlds Fairs). Of the most luxurious of these, the Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz appeared in the Place Vendôme in 1898, and the Hôtel de Crillon opened its doors on the north side of the Place de la Concorde, starting in 1909.

Paris newest (and third-largest) museum, the Musée du quai Branly, opened its doors in June 2006 and houses art from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas.

Many of Paris once-popular local establishments have come to cater to the tastes and expectations of tourists, rather than local patrons, such as Le Lido on the Avenue Champs-Élysées, among others. The Moulin Rouge cabaret-dancehall, for example, is a staged dinner theatre spectacle, a dance display that was once but one aspect of the cabarets former atmosphere. All of the establishments former social or cultural elements, such as its ballrooms and gardens, are gone today. Much of Paris hotel, restaurant and night entertainment trades have become heavily dependent on tourism.

==Economy==
 
  GDP of highest GDPs in the world,  after Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles and London, making it an engine of the global economy; were it a country, it would rank as the seventeenth-largest economy in the world, larger than the Turkish and Dutch economies and almost as large as the Indonesian economy.    The Paris Region is Frances premier centre of economic activity. While its population accounted for 18.8% of the total population of metropolitan France in 2011,  its GDP accounted for 31.0% of metropolitan Frances GDP.  Activity in the Paris urban area, though diverse, does not have a leading specialised industry (such as Los Angeles with entertainment industries or London and New York with financial industries in addition to their other activities). Recently, the Paris economy has been shifting towards high-value-added service industries (Financial services|finance, IT services, etc.) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). However, in the 2009 European Green City Index, Paris was still listed as the second most "green" large city in Europe, after Berlin. 

The Paris regions most intense economic activity through the central  , it remains an important manufacturing powerhouse of Europe, especially in industrial sectors such as automobiles, aeronautics, and electronics. Over recent decades, the local economy has moved towards high-value-added activities, in particular business services. Paris is the first in Europe in terms of research and development capability and expenditure  and is considered one of the best cities in the world for innovation.  The Paris Region hosts the headquarters of 33 of the Fortune Global 500 companies.   
 health services; electronic and Tourism and tourist related services employ 6.2% of Paris workforce, and 3.6% of all workers within the Paris Region.     Unemployment in the Paris "immigrant Banlieue|ghettos" ranges from 20 to 40%, according to varying sources.

===Health===
 
Health care and emergency medical service in the city of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.  It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. It employs more than 90,000 people (including 15,800 physicians) in 44 hospitals and receives more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.   This number covers consultations ("Activité ambulatoire externe") plus hospitalizations ("Activité médicale").  One of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city. 

==Sociology==
 
 
Paris is richer than the rest of France, with a 2010 median income by consumption unit of 25,000 €, against 22,000 € For the whole Île-de-France region and 18,750 € for Metropolitan France. However, prices are also 13% higher in Île-de-France than in the rest of France, mostly because of real estate,  and income inequalities are high. At 0.49, Paris Gini coefficient is the second highest in France after Neuilly-sur-Seine.  Wealth is heavily concentrated in the Western part of Paris proper, and in Western suburbs, notably Neuilly-sur-Seine,  and rents are generally much higher on the western side. This mirrors a sharp political divide, with political conservatism being much more common towards the western edge, whilst the political spectrum lies more to the left in the east. 

Paris is the département with the highest proportion of highly-educated people. In 2009, around 40% of Parisians hold a diploma Licentiate#France|licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,  while 13% have no diploma, the third lowest percentage in France.

La Rive Droite ( , The Right Bank) is most associated with the river  ) is to the left. 

==Demographics==
 
 
 
The population of the city of Paris was 2,125,246 at the 1999 census, lower than its historical peak of 2.9&nbsp;million in 1921. The citys population loss mirrors the experience of most other core cities in the developed world that have not expanded their boundaries. The principal factors in the process are a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975.

Factors in the migration include Deindustrialization|de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The citys population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents. These losses are generally seen as negative for the city; the city administration is trying to reverse them with some success, as the population estimate of July 2004 showed a population increase for the first time since 1954, reaching a total of 2,144,700 inhabitants, which reached 2,234,000 by 2009.     

===Density=== Boulogne and megapolises and borough of Manhattan. Even including the two woodland areas, its population density was 20,164 inhabitants per square kilometre (52,224.5/sq mi), the fifth-most-densely populated commune in France following Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, Vincennes, Levallois-Perret, and Saint-Mandé, all of which border the city proper.
 11th arrondissement had a density of 40,672 inhabitants per square kilometre (105,340/sq mi) in 1999, and some of the same arrondissements eastern quarters had densities close to 100,000/km 2  (260,000/sq&nbsp;mi) in the same year. 

===Paris agglomeration=== Paris aire urbaine, which, in 2010, was populated by over 12 million people.   

The Paris agglomeration has shown a steady rate of growth since the end of the late 16th century   région in France|région shows a rate of growth double that of the 1990s.      

===Immigration===
By law, French censuses do not ask questions regarding ethnicity or religion, but do gather information concerning ones country of birth. From this it is still possible to determine that Paris and its aire urbaine (metropolitan area) is one of the most multi-cultural in Europe: At the 1999 census, 19.4% of its total population was born outside of metropolitan France.     At the same census, 4.2% of the Paris aire urbaines population were recent immigrants (people who had immigrated to France between 1990 and 1999),     the majority from Asia and Africa.     37% of all immigrants in France live in the Paris region.   
 revolution of genocide in the Ottoman Empire;  colonial citizens during World War I and later; Poles between the two world wars; Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, and North Africans from the 1950s to the 1970s; North African Jews after the independence of those countries; Africans and Asians since then.   

The Paris metropolitan region or "aire urbaine" is estimated to be home to some 1.7&nbsp;million Muslims, making up between 10%–15% of the areas population. However, without official data, the margin of error of these estimates is extremely high as it is based on ones country of birth (someone born in a Muslim country or born to a parent from a Muslim country is considered as a "potential Muslim").  According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, an estimated 310,000&nbsp;Jews also live in Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region, an area with a population of 11.7&nbsp;million inhabitants. Paris has historically been a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe today.   

====Immigrants and their children in départements of Île-de-France (Greater Paris)====

About four million people, or 35% of the population of the Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France, are either immigrants (17%) or have at least one immigrant parent (18%).  According to a study in 2008, nearly 56% of all newborns in Île-de-France in 2007 had at least one parent of immigrant origin.

==Administration==
Paris, its administrative limits unchanged since 1860 (save for the addition of two large parks), is one of a few cities that have not evolved politically with their real demographic growth; this issue is at present being discussed in plans for a "Grand Paris" (Greater Paris) which could extend Paris administrative limits to embrace much more of its urban tissue.

In 1790, Paris became the  , Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne were created and given the numbers 92, 93, and 94, respectively. The result of this division is that today Paris limits as a département are exactly those of its limits as a commune, a situation unique in France. 

===Municipal offices===
Each of Paris twenty arrondissements has a directly elected council (conseil darrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. A selection of members from each arrondissement council form the Council of Paris (conseil de Paris), which, in turn, elects the mayor of Paris.

|} lieutenant general of police upon its creation in 1667. For centuries, the prévôt and magistrates of the Châtelet clashed with the administrators of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville over jurisdiction;  the latter notably included the quartiniers, each of whom was responsible for one of the sixteen Quarter (country subdivision)|quartiers (which were in turn divided into fourcinquantaines, each with its cinquantainier, and those in turn were divided into dizaines, administered bydizainiers): 
All of these men were in principle elected by the local bourgeois. At any one time, therefore, 336 men had shared administrative responsibility for street cleaning and maintenance, for public health, law, and order. The quartiniers maintained the official lists of bourgeois de Paris, ran local elections, could impose fines for breaches of the bylaws, and had a role in tax assessment. They met at the Hôtel de Ville to confer on matters of citywide importance and each year selected eight of "the most notable inhabitants of the quarter", who together with other local officials would elect the city council.  

Even though in the course of the 18th century these elections became purely ceremonial, choosing candidates already selected by the royal government, the memory of genuine municipal independence remained strong: "The Hôtel de Ville continued to bulk large in the awareness of bourgeois Parisians, its importance extending far beyond its real role in city government." 

Paris last Provost (civil)|Prévôt des marchands was assassinated the afternoon of the 14 July 1789 uprising that was the French Revolution Storming of the Bastille. Paris became an official "commune" from the creation of the administrative division on 14 December the same year, and its provisional "Paris commune" revolutionary municipality was replaced with the citys first municipal constitution and government from 9 October 1790.    Through the turmoil of the 1794 Thermidorian Reaction, it became apparent that revolutionary Paris political independence was a threat to any governing power: The office of mayor was abolished the same year, and its municipal council one year later.

  (town hall)]] Seine départements Prefect of Police was in charge of police in the same jurisdiction. Save for a few brief occasions, the city did not have a mayor until 1977, and the Paris Prefecture of Police is still under state control today.

Despite its dual existence as commune and département, Paris has a single council to govern both; the Council of Paris, presided over by the mayor of Paris, meets as either as a municipal council (conseil municipal) or a departmental council (conseil général), depending on the issue to be debated.

Paris modern administrative organisation still retains some traces of the former Seine département jurisdiction. The Prefecture of Police (also directing Paris fire brigades), for example, has still a jurisdiction extending to Paris petite couronne of bordering three départements for some operations such as fire protection or rescue operations, and is still directed by Frances national government. Paris has no municipal police force, although it does have its own brigade of traffic wardens.

===Capital of the Île-de-France région===
 .]]
As part of a 1961 nation-wide administrative effort to consolidate regional economies, Paris as a département in France|département became the capital of the new Regions of France|région of the District of Paris, renamed the Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France région in France|région in 1976. It encompasses the Paris département and its seven closest départements. Its regional council members, since 1986, have been chosen by direct elections.

The prefect of the Paris département (who served as the prefect of the Seine département before 1968) is also prefect of the Île-de-France région, although the office lost much of its power following the creation of the office of mayor of Paris in 1977.

===Intercommunality=== intercommunal entity in the Paris urban area, no intercommunal council treating the problems of the regions dense urban core as a whole; Paris alienation of its suburbs is indeed a problem today, and considered by many   to be the main causes of civil unrest such as the suburban riots in 2005. A direct result of these unfortunate events is propositions for a more efficient metropolitan structure to cover the city of Paris and some of the suburbs, ranging from a socialist idea of a loose "metropolitan conference" (conférence métropolitaine) to the right-wing idea of a more integrated Grand Paris ("Greater Paris").

One of the main reasons for such incoherence has been the fear felt by the French State in front of such a huge agglomeration and the desire to tap its wealth.   Since the Middle Ages and particularly since the
