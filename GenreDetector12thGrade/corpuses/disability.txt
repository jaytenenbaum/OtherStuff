Disability is the consequence of an impairment that may be physical, cognitive, mental, sensory, emotional, developmental, or some combination of these. A disability may be present from birth, or occur during a persons lifetime.

 
 standard or cognitive or developmental disabilities. Mental disorders (also known as psychiatric or psychosocial disability) and various types of chronic disease may also qualify as disabilities.
 deafness and autism spectrum|autism) as "disabilities", arguing that it is more appropriate to consider them developmental differences that have been unfairly stigmatized by society.   

==Types of disability==
The term "disability" broadly describes an impairment in a persons ability to function, caused by changes in various subsystems of the body, or to mental health. The degree of disability may range from mild to moderate, severe, or profound.  A person may also have multiple disabilities.

Conditions causing disability are classified by the medical community as:  
* inherited (genetically transmitted);
* congenital, meaning caused by a mothers infection during pregnancy, or by injury during or soon after birth;
* acquired, such as conditions caused by illness or injury; or
* of unknown origin.

Types of disability may also be categorized in the following way:

===Physical disability===
 
Any impairment which limits the physical function of limbs, fine bones, or gross motor ability is a physical disability.  Other physical disabilities include impairments which limit other facets of daily living, such as severe sleep apnea.
 

===Sensory disability===
 
Sensory disability is impairment of one of the senses. The term is used primarily to refer to vision and hearing impairment, but other senses can be impaired.

====Vision impairment====
  visual capability resulting from either disease, Physical trauma|trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery. Arditi, A., & Rosenthal, B. (1998). "Developing an objective definition of visual impairment." In Vision 96: Proceedings of the International Low Vision Conference (pp. 331334). Madrid, Spain: ONCE.     
     This functional loss of vision is typically defined to manifest with
# best corrected visual acuity of less than 20/60, or significant central field defect,
# significant peripheral field defect including homonymous or heteronymous bilateral visual, field defect or generalized contraction or constriction of field, or
# reduced peak contrast sensitivity with either of the above conditions.    

====Hearing impairment====
 
Hearing impairment or hard of hearing or deafness refers to conditions in which individuals are fully or partially unable to detect or perceive at least some frequencies of sound which can typically be heard by most people. Mild hearing loss may sometimes not be considered a disability.

====Olfactory and gustatory impairment====
Impairment of the sense of smell and taste are commonly associated with aging but can also occur in younger people due to a wide variety of causes.
 
There are various olfactory disorders:
*Anosmia&nbsp; inability to smell
*Dysosmia&nbsp; things smell different than they should
*Hyperosmia&nbsp; an abnormally acute sense of smell.
*Hyposmia&nbsp; decreased ability to smell
*Olfactory Reference Syndrome&nbsp; psychological disorder which causes patients to imagine they have strong body odor
*Parosmia&nbsp; things smell worse than they should
*Phantosmia&nbsp; "hallucinated smell", often unpleasant in nature 

 
Complete loss of the sense of taste is known as ageusia, while dysgeusia is persistent abnormal sense of taste,

====Somatosensory impairment====
 
Insensitivity to stimuli such as touch, heat, cold, and pain are often an adjunct to a more general physical impairment involving neural pathways and is very commonly associated with paralysis (in which the motor neural circuits are also affected).

====Balance disorder====
 
A balance disorder is a disturbance that causes an individual to feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by symptoms of being giddy, woozy, or have a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance is the result of several body systems working together. The eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the bodys sense of where it is in space (proprioception) need to be intact. The brain, which compiles this information, needs to be functioning effectively.

===Intellectual disability===
 
Intellectual disability is a broad concept that ranges from mental retardation to cognitive deficits too mild or too specific (as in specific learning disability) to qualify as mental retardation. Intellectual disabilities may appear at any age. Mental retardation is a subtype of intellectual disability, and the term intellectual disability is now preferred by many advocates in most English-speaking countries as a euphemism for mental retardation.

===Mental health and emotional disabilities===
 
A mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological or behavioural pattern generally associated with subjective distress or disability that occurs in an individual, and perceived by the majority of society as being outside of normal development or cultural expectations. The recognition and understanding of mental health conditions has changed over time and across cultures, and there are still variations in the definition, assessment, and classification of mental disorders, although standard guideline criteria are widely accepted.

===Developmental disability===
  growth and development.  Although the term is often used  as a synonym or euphemism for intellectual disability, the term also encompasses many congenital medical conditions that have no mental or intellectual components, for example spina bifida.

===Nonvisible disabilities===
 
Several chronic disorders, such as diabetes, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease or epilepsy, would be counted as nonvisible disabilities, as opposed to disabilities which are clearly visible, such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair.

===Terminology===
Different terms have been used for people with disabilities in different times and places.  The euphemism treadmill and changing fashions have caused terms to rise or fall in popularity. 

At this time, disability or impairment are commonly used, as are more specific terms, such as blind (to describe having no vision at all) or visually impaired (to describe having limited vision).
 false folk etymology that says it is a reference to begging.  It is actually derived from an old game, Hand-i-cap, in which two players trade possessions and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions.   The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to handicap racing in the mid-18th century.  In handicap racing, horses carry different weights based on the umpires estimation of what would make them run equally.  The use of the term to describe a person with a disabilityby extension from handicap racing, a person carrying a heavier burden than normalappeared in the early 20th century.     

Handicap replaced terms that are now considered insulting, such as crippled.

===People-first language===
 
Many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability instead of handicapped. "Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care" at the University of Delaware offers the following guidelines: 

 
 style guide blind person", autistic boy"; more acceptable terminology includes "a woman with Down syndrome" or "a man who has schizophrenia". It also states that a persons adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, for example, "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair."
 social model social model. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as Disabled Peoples International (DPI).

In Leonard Kriegels book, Flying Solo, he describes his fight with  , 1998). ISBN 0-8070-7230-3 

====Femininity====
Some note that women who are disabled face what is called a "double disability", meaning they must not only deal with the stereotypes and challenges posed by femininity, but they must also deal with those posed by being disabled. Culture also tends to view women as fragile and weaker than men, stereotypes which are only heightened when a woman has a disability. 

According to the "Survey of Income and Program Participation", as described in the book Gendering Disability, 74 percent of women participants and 90 percent of men participants without disabilities were employed. In comparison, of those with a form of disability, 41 percent of women and 51 percent of men were employed. Furthermore, the nondisabled women participants were paid approximately $4.00 less per hour than the nondisabled men participants. With a disability, women were paid approximately $1.00 less than the nondisabled women participants and the men were paid approximately $2.00 less than the nondisabled men participants. As these results suggest, women without disabilities face societal hardships as compared to men, but disability added to the equation increases the hardships. 

===Disability and poverty===
There is a global correlation between disability and poverty, produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life. Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf 

===Disability and disasters===
 
There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact people with disabilities.     Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters.     Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available. Individuals with cognitive impairments may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs.    Those who are blindness|blind, hearing impaired, etc. may have difficulty communicating during the emergency. All of these factors can increase the degree of variation of risk in disaster situations with disabled individuals. 

Research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of the disaster cycle.  The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or transportation, as well as access disaster-related services.  The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and disaster relief personnel. 

==Theory==
The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), produced by the World Health Organization, distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:
*Learning and applying knowledge
*General tasks and demands
*Communication
*Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (for example, activities of daily living)
*Interpersonal interactions and relationships
*Community, social and civic life, including employment
*Other major life areas
In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models has been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

===The medical model===
 

The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure," or the individuals adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming healthcare policy.  

===The social model===
  integration of social action and it is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both cultural and ideological, requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights issue of major concern.   Medical humanities can bridge the gap between medical and social model of disability. 

===Other models===
* The spectrum model refers to the range of visibility, audibility and sensibility under which people function. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations. Rather, disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability.  
* The moral model refers to the attitude that people are morally responsible for their own disability.    For example disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if congenital, or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not.  Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of karma in Indian religions. It also includes notions that a disability gives a person "special abilities to perceive, reflect, transcend, be spiritual".  
* The expert/professional model has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client. 
* The tragedy/charity model depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of pity. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability. 
* The legitimacy model views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable. 
* The social adapted model states although a persons disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, oftentimes the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself. 
* The economic model defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general.  This model is directly related to the charity/tragedy model. 
* The empowering model (also, customer model)allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of their treatment and what services they wish to benefit from. This, in turn, turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the clients decisions. This model empowers the individual to pursue his/her own goals. 
*The market model of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing people with disabilities and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.  By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability.  An additional two billion people are considered stakeholders in disability (family/friends/employers), and when combined to the number of people without disabilities, represents 53% of the population.  "This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream." 
*The consumer model of disability is based upon the rights-based" model and claims that people with disabilities should have equal rights and access to products, goods and services offered by businesses.  The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation, but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage people with disabilities in all aspects of business service activities.  The model suggests that all business operations, for example websites, policies and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices.  Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.

===Assistive technology===
 
Assistive Technology is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a prosthesis dates to at least 1800 BC.  The wheelchair dates from the 17th century.  The curb cut is a related structural innovation. Other examples are standing frames, text telephones, accessible Keyboard (computing)|keyboards, large print, Braille, & speech recognition software. People with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in Tourettes syndrome), or sign language in deaf communities.
 develop software hardware to make computers more accessible for people with disabilities. Some software and hardware, such as Voice Finger, Freedom Scientifics JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS, the Free and Open Source alternative Orca (assistive technology)|Orca etc. have been specifically designed for people with disabilities while other software and hardware, such as Nuance Communications|Nuances Dragon NaturallySpeaking, were not developed specifically for people with disabilities, but can be used to increase accessibility. 
The LOMAK keyboard was designed in New Zealand specifically for persons with disabilities.  
The World Wide Web consortium recognised a need for Interntional Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).  As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 

===Adapted sports===
  2008 Summer Paralympics]]
The Paralympic Games (meaning "alongside the Olympics") are held after the (Summer and Winter) Olympics. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, BlazeSports America in the United States).

The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients.

In 2006, the Extremity Games was formed for people with physical disabilities, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in extreme sports. 

==Discrimination, government policies, and support==
 

===United Nations===
On December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally agreed on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the worlds estimated 650 million disabled people.  As of April 2011, 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention.  Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments.

In 1976, the United Nations launched its International Year for Disabled Persons (1981), later renamed the International Year of Disabled Persons. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (19831993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, Frank Bowe was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by Robert Davila. Both Bowe and Davila are deaf. In 1984, UNESCO accepted sign language for use in education of deaf children and youth.

===Costa Rica===
Under the Ley de Igualdad de Oportunidades (Law of Equal Opportunities), no person can be discriminated by their disabilities if they are equally capable as another person. This law also promotes that public places and transport should have facilities that enable people with disabilities to access them.

May 28 is the Da Nacional de la Persona con Discapacidad (National Disabled People Day) to promote respect for this population.
 Oscar Lpez, is blind.

===United Kingdom=== Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) (1995, extended in 2005), it is unlawful for organisations to discriminate (treat a disabled person less favourably, for reasons related to the persons disability, without justification) in employment; access to goods, facilities, services; managing, buying or renting land or property; education. Businesses must make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, to avoid indirect discrimination. 

Since 2010 the Disability Discrimination Act has been replaced with the Equality Act 2010. This act still protects disabled people against discrimination but also encompasses a number of other  characteristics including age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, pregnancy, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation. 

A number of financial and care support services are available (see disability benefits), including Incapacity Benefit and Disability Living Allowance.

====Employment====
 
The Business Disability Forum (BDF), formerly the Employers Forum on Disability, is a membership organisation of UK businesses.    Following the introduction of the DDA the membership of BDF recognised the need for a tool with which they could measure their performance on disability year on year.

In 2005 eighty organisations took part in the Disability Standard benchmark providing the first statistics highlighting the UKs performance as a nation of employers.
 benchmark Disability Standard 2007 saw the introduction of the Chief Executives Diamond Awards for outstanding performance and 116 organisations taking the opportunity to compare trends across a large group of UK employers and monitor the progress they had made on disability.

2009 saw the introduction of the third benchmark, Disability Standard 2009.  

In 2012 BDF had a number of initiatives to assist businesses in
