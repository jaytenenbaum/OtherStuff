Jordan ( ;  }}  ), officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ( }}  ), is an Arab kingdom in the Middle East, on the East Bank of the River Jordan, and extending into the historic region of Palestine (region)|Palestine. Jordan borders Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north and Israel to the west, sharing control of the Dead Sea with the latter.

The desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France. In 1946, Jordan became an independent sovereign state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. After capturing the West Bank area of Cisjordan during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War|194849 war with Israel, Abdullah I took the title King of Jordan and Palestine, and he officially changed the countrys name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949.

Modern Jordan is classified as a country of "medium human development"  by the 2011 Human Development Report, and an emerging market with the third freest economy in West Asia and North Africa (32nd freest worldwide).    Jordan has an "upper middle income" economy.    Jordan has enjoyed "advanced status" with the European Union since December 2010,  and it is also a member of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League,  and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).

==History==
 
  Oval Piazza in the ancient city of Jerash.]]
In antiquity, the present day Jordan became a home for several ancient kingdoms including: the kingdom of Edom, the kingdom of Moab and the kingdom of Ammon. Throughout different eras of history, parts of the country were laid under the control of some regional powers including Pharaonic Egypt during their wars with the Babylonians and the Hittites|Hittites; and for discrete periods of times by Israelites. The Mesha Stele recorded the glory of the King of Edom and the victories over the Israelites and other nations. The Ammon and Moab kingdoms are mentioned in ancient maps, Near Eastern documents, ancient Greco-Roman artifacts, and Christian and Jewish religious scriptures. 

===Classical Transjordan=== Persians and Macedonian Greeks, who became the dominant force in the region, following the conquests of Alexander the Great. It later fell under the changing influence of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire from the North and the Parthians from the East.
 Nabatean kingdom Modern Arabic.

The Nabateans were largely conquered by the Hasmonean rulers of Judea and many of them forced to convert to Judaism in the late second century BC. However, the Nabataeans managed to maintain a sort of semi-independent kingdom, which covered most parts of modern Jordan and beyond, before it was taken by the Herodians and finally annexed by the still expanding Roman empire in 106 AD. However, apart from Petra, the Romans maintained the prosperity of most of the ancient cities in Transjordan which enjoyed a sort of city-state autonomy under the umbrella of the alliance of the Decapolis. Nabataean civilization left many magnificent archaeological sites at Petra, which is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World as well as recognized by the UNESCO as a world Heritage site.
 Dion (Capitolias), Pella (Irbid).

With the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire, Transjordan came to be controlled by the Christian Ghassanid Arab kingdom, which allied with Byzantium. The Byzantine site of Um er-Rasas is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Middle Ages to World War I=== Arabic Islamic Empire and therefore secured several centuries of stability and prosperity,  which allowed the coining of its current Arabic Islamic identity. Different Caliphates stages, including the Rashidun Empire, Umayyad Empire and Abbasid Empire controlled the region. Several resources pointed that the Abbasid movement, was started in region of Transjordan before it took over the Umayyad empire. After the decline of the Abbasid, It was ruled by several conflicting powers including the Mongols, the Crusaders, the Ayyubids and the Mamluks until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516. 

The Umayyad caliphs constructed rural estates such as Qasr Mshatta, Qasr al Hallabat, Qasr Kharana, Qasr Tuba, and Qasr Amra. Castles constructed in the later Middle Ages including Ajloun, Al Karak, and Qasr Azraq were used in the  Ayyubid, Crusader, and Mamluk eras.

In the 11th century, Transjordan witnessed a phase of instability, as it became a battlefield for the Crusades which ended with defeat by the Ayyubids. Jordan suffered also from the Mongol attacks which were blocked by Mamluks.
  Great Arab Revolt took over, and secured the present day Jordan with the help and support of Transjordanian local tribes.
 
  (Circassians|Circassian) horsemanship in Transjordan, April 1921.]]
During World War&nbsp;I, the Transjordanian tribes fought, along with other tribes of the Hijaz, the Tihamah, and Levant regions, as part of the Arab Army of the Great Arab Revolt. The revolt was launched by the Hashemites and led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca against the Ottoman Empire. It was supported by the Allies of World War&nbsp;I. The chronicle of the revolt was written by T.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Lawrence who, as a young British Army officer, played a liaison role during the revolt. He published the chronicle in London, 1922 under the title "Seven Pillars of Wisdom",  which was the basis for the iconic movie "Lawrence of Arabia".

The Great Arab Revolt was successful in gaining independence for most of the territories of Hijaz and the Levant, including the region of east of Jordan. However, it failed to gain international recognition of the region as an independent state, due mainly to the secret SykesPicot Agreement|SykesPicot Agreement of 1916 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917.  This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as betrayal of the previous agreements with the British, including the McMahonHussein Correspondence in 1915, in which the British stated their willingness to recognize the independence of the Arab state in Hijaz and the Levant. However, a compromise was eventually reached and the Emirate of Transjordan was created under the reign of the Hashemites.

===British Mandate on Transjordan===
  British Mandate and Transjordan memorandum excluded the territories east of the River Jordan from all of the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement.  The Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that both a Jewish and an Arab state in the Mandatory regions of Palestine and Transjordan were to be newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.  The country remained under British supervision until 1946.

===Independence=== British Mandate King Abdullah as the first King. The countrys name was later changed from Transjordan to Jordan. 

On 24 April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem, an act that was regarded as illegal and void by the Arab League. The move formed part of Jordans "Greater Syria Plan" expansionist policy,    and in response, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Syria joined Egypt in demanding Jordans expulsion from the Arab League.       A motion to expel Jordan from the League was prevented by the dissenting votes of Yemen and Iraq.    On 12 June 1950, the Arab League declared the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that Jordan was holding the territory as a trustee pending a future settlement.  

Abdullah I was assassinated in 1951 by a Palestinian militant Mustafa Ashu, of the jihad al-muqaddas, as he was leaving the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The reason for his murder was allegedly the power rivalry of the al-Husseinis over control of Palestine, which was declared a part of the Hashemite Kingdom by Abdullah&nbsp;I. Though Amin al-Husseini, former mufti of Jerusalem, was not directly charged in the plot, Musa al-Husseini was among the 6 executed by Jordanian authorities, following the assassination.

On 27 July 1953, King Hussein of Jordan announced that East Jerusalem was "the capital of the Hashemite Kingdom" and would form an "integral and inseparable part" of Jordan.    In 1957 Jordan terminated the Anglo-Jordanian treaty, one year after the king sacked the British personnel serving in the Jordanian Army. This act of Arabization ensured the complete sovereignty of Jordan as a fully independent nation.

  and former prime minister Wasfi Al-Tal]] Black September.
 King Hussein urgently asked the United States and Great Britain to intervene against Syria. Consequently, Israel performed mock air strikes on the Syrian column at the Americans request. Soon after, Syrian President Nureddin al-Atassi, ordered a hasty retreat from Jordanian soil.     By 22 September, Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. However, sporadic violence continued until Jordanian forces, led by Habis Al-Majali, with the help of Iraqi forces,    won a decisive victory over the fedayeen on July 1971, expelling them, and ultimately the PLOs Yasser Arafat of Jordan.

In 1973, allied Arab League forces attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War, and fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line. Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to attack Israeli units on Syrian territory but did not engage Israeli forces from Jordanian territory. At the Rabat summit conference in 1974, Jordan was now in a more secure position to agree, along with the rest of the Arab League, that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.

The Amman Agreement of 11 February 1985, declared that the PLO and Jordan would pursue a proposed confederation between the state of Jordan and a Palestinian state.  In 1988, King Hussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament and renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank. The PLO assumed responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine and an independent state was declared. 

  and Yitzhak Rabin, accompanied by Bill Clinton, after signing the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace, 26 October 1994.]]
In 1991 Jordan agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel at the Madrid Conference, sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union. It negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on 25 July 1994. As a result, an Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty was concluded on 26 October 1994. King Hussein was later honored when his picture appeared on an Israeli postage stamp in recognition of the good relations he established with his neighbor. Since the signing of the peace treaty, the United States not only contributes hundreds of millions of dollars in an annual foreign aid stipend to Jordan, but also has allowed it to establish a free trade zone in which to manufacture goods that will enter the US without paying the usual import taxes as long as a percentage of the material used in them is purchased in Israel.

The last major strain in Jordans relations with Israel occurred in September 1997, when Israeli agents allegedly entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior leader of Hamas. Israel provided an antidote to the poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
 
Abdullah became king on 7 February 1999, upon the death of his father King Hussein. Hussein had recently named him Crown Prince on 24 January, replacing Husseins brother Prince Hassan of Jordan|Hassan, who had served many years in the position. He is the namesake of King Abdullah I, his great grandfather who founded modern Jordan. 

Jordans economy has improved greatly since Abdullah ascended to the throne in 1999, and he has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships, and providing the foundation for  , Ajloun, Mafraq, Maan, and the Dead Sea. As a result of these reforms, Jordans economic growth has doubled to 6% annually under King Abdullahs rule compared to the latter half of the 1990s.  Foreign direct investment from the West as well as the countries of the Persian Gulf has continued to increase.  He also negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States, which was the third free trade agreement for the U.S. and the first with an Arab country. 

During the suspension of Parliament between 2001 and 2003, the scope of King Abdullah IIs power was demonstrated with the passing of 110 temporary laws. Two of these laws dealt with elections and were criticized as having the effect of reducing the power of Parliament.   In 2005 King Abdullah expressed his intentions of making Jordan a democratic country.  Thus far, however, democratic development has been limited, with the monarchy maintaining most power and its allies dominating parliament. Elections were held in November 2010.
 King Abdallah replaced his prime minister and formed a National Dialogue Commission with a reform mandate. The King told the new prime minister to "take quick, concrete and practical steps to launch a genuine political reform process", "to strengthen democracy," and provide Jordanians with the "dignified life they deserve."  The King called for an "immediate revision" of laws governing politics and public freedoms.  Initial reports say that this effort has started slowly and that several "fundamental rights" are not being addressed.

The Parliament of Jordan consists of two Chambers: The Chamber of Deputies (Majlis al-Nuwaab) and the Senate (Majlis al-Aayan; literally, Assembly of Notables). The Senate has 60 Senators, all of whom are directly appointed by the King,  while the Chamber of Deputies/House of Representatives has 120 elected members representing 12 constituencies. The elected Chamber of Deputies can initiate legislation, but it has to pass through the senate and government, which are both appointed by the King.

Civil courts have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases, while the sharia courts have jurisdiction over personal status for Muslims, including marriage, divorce, and inheritance; parallel tribunals handle such matters for non-Muslims.  Sharia courts also have jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the Islamic waqfs. In cases involving parties of different religions, regular courts have jurisdiction.   

The Constitution of Jordan was adopted on January 11, 1952 and has been amended many times. Article 97 of Jordans constitution guarantees the independence of the judicial branch, clearly stating that judges are subject to no authority but that of the law. While the king must approve the appointment and dismissal of judges, in practice these are supervised by the Higher Judicial Council. Article 99 of the Constitution divides the courts into three categories: civil, religious and special. The civil courts deal with civil and criminal matters in accordance with the law, and they have jurisdiction over all persons in all matters, civil and criminal, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts and the Supreme Court.

Jordan also ranked 13th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East in terms of prevention of organized crime, making it one of the safest countries in the world.   

===Foreign relations===
 
 
Jordan has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. These relations were damaged by Jordans neutrality and maintaining relations with Iraq during the first Gulf War. Following the Gulf War, Jordan largely restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the Southwest Asia peace process and enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq. Relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries improved substantially after King Husseins death.

  Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the forces to react rapidly to threats to state security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond.  

There are about 50,000 Jordanian troops working with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions across the world. These soldiers provide everything from military defense, training of native police, medical help, and charity. Jordan ranks third internationally in taking part in UN peacekeeping missions.  Jordan has one of the highest levels of peacekeeping troop contributions of all U.N. member states. 

Jordan has dispatched several field hospitals to conflict zones and areas affected by natural disasters across the world such as Iraq, the West Bank, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sierra Leone and Pakistan. The Kingdoms field hospitals extended aid to more than one million people in Iraq, some one million in the West Bank and 55,000 in Lebanon. According to the military, there are Jordanian peacekeeping forces in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Jordanian Armed Forces field hospital in Afghanistan has since 2002 provided assistance to some 750,000 persons and has significantly reduced the suffering of people residing in areas where the hospital operates.In some missions, the number of Jordanian troops was the second largest, the sources said.  Jordan also provides extensive training of security forces in Iraq,  the Palestinian territories,  and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC.

The 2010 Arab Democracy Index from the Arab Reform Initiative ranked Jordan first in the state of democratic reforms out of fifteen Arab countries. 
 Freedom in the World 2011 report, where 1 is most free and 7 is least free. This earned Jordan "Not Free" status.  Jordan ranked ahead of 6, behind 4, and the same as 8 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Jordan ranked 6th among the 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, and 50th out of 178 countries worldwide in the 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) issued by Transparency International.  Jordans 2010 CPI score was 4.7 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean). Jordan ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) in February 2005  and has been a regional leader in spearheading efforts to promote the UNCAC and its implementation. 
 Pew Global death penalty leave Islam; 58% supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery; and 70% support stoning people who commit adultery.   

==Economy==
 
 
Jordan is classified by the World Bank as an "upper middle income country."  The economy has grown at an average rate of 4.3% per annum since 2005.  Approximately 13% of the population lives on less than US$ 3 a day. 

The GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s.   Jordan has a free trade agreement with Turkey.  Jordan also enjoys advanced status with the EU. 

The Jordanian economy is beset by insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural resources.  Other challenges include high budget deficit, high outstanding public debt, high levels of poverty and unemployment.  Unemployment for 2012 is nominally around 13%, but is thought by many analysts to be as high as a quarter of the working age population.  Youth unemployment is nearly 30%.  Jordan has few natural resources and a small industrial base.  Corruption is particularly pronounced, and the use of wasta is widespread.  Jordan suffers from a brain drain of its most talented workers.  Remittances from Jordanian expatriates are a major source of foreign exchange. 

Due to slow domestic growth, high energy and food subsidies and a bloated public sector workforce, Jordan usually runs annual budget deficits, which are partially offsets by international aid. 

Jordans economy is relatively well diversified.  Trade and finance combined account for nearly one-third of GDP; transportation and communication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and mining and manufacturing constitute nearly that proportion.  Despite plans to increase the private sector, the state remains the dominant force in Jordans economy.    The government employs between one-third and two-thirds of all workers. 

In 2000, Jordan joined the World Trade Organization and signed the JordanUnited States Free Trade Agreement; in 2001, it signed an association agreement with the European Union.   

Net official development assistance to Jordan in 2009 totalled USD 761 million; according to the government, approximately two-thirds of this was allocated as grants, of which half was direct budget support.   

The Great Recession and the turmoil caused by the Arab Spring have depressed Jordans GDP growth, impacting export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism.  Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011, hitting an important source of revenue and employment.   
 natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, causing Jordan to substitute more expensive heavy fuel oils to generate electricity.    The government was then forced to spend at least $500 million to cover the resulting fuel shortage. 

The International Monetary Fund agreed to a three-year, $2 billion loan in August 2012. As part of the deal, Jordan was expected to cut spending.  In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel.  As a result, large scale protests broke out across the country, and the King subsequently reversed the increase.   

The total foreign debt in 2012 was $22 billion, representing 72% of GDP. Roughly two-thirds of this total had been raised on the domestic market, with the remaining owed to overseas lenders.    In late November 2012, the budgetary shortfall was estimated at around $3 billion, or about 11% of GDP.  Growth was expected to reach 3% by the end of 2012, and the IMF predicts GDP will increase by 3.5% in 2013, rising to 4.5% by 2017.  The inflation rate was forecast at 4.5% by the end of 2012. 

The official currency in Jordan is the Jordanian dinar, which is pegged to the IMFs special drawing rights (SDRs), equivalent to an exchange rate of 1 US$ = 0.709 dinar, or approximately 1 dinar = 1.41044 dollars. 

The proportion of skilled workers in Jordan is among the highest in the region.  Agriculture in Jordan constituted almost 40% of GNP in the early 1950s; on the eve of the June 1967 War, it was 17%.    By the mid-1980s, agricultures share of GNP in Jordan was only about 6%.  Jordan has hosted the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa six times and plans to hold it again at the Dead Sea for the seventh time in 2013. 

===Natural resources===
  Phosphate mines in the south have made Jordan one of the largest producers and exporters of this mineral in the world.     

Four nuclear power plants are planned with the first one to be operational in 2019. 

Since the beginning of 2010, the government of Jordan has been seeking approval from the US for producing nuclear fuel from Jordans uranium for use in nuclear power plants that Jordan plans to build. According to Haaretz, Jordan learned that the US position is essentially the Israeli position, and the US has rejected Jordans request for approval. 

Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987, and the estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, and quantities are very modest compared with its neighbours. It was the development of the Risha field in the Eastern Desert beside the Iraqi border, and the field produces nearly 30 million cubic feet of gas a day, to be sent to a nearby power plant to produce nearly 10% of the Jordans Electric needs. 

Despite the fact that reserves of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan possesses one of the worlds richest stockpiles of oil shale where there are huge quantities that could be commercially exploited in the central and northern regions west of the country. The moisture content and ash within is relatively low. And the total thermal value is 7.5 megajoules/kg, and the content of ointments reach 9% of the weight of the organic content.  A switch to power plants operated by oil shale has the potential to reduce Jordans energy bill by at least 4050 per cent, according to the National Electric Power Company. 

===Tourism===

Tourism accounted for 10%12% of the countrys Gross National Product in 2006. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion if medical tourists are included.  Jordan offers everything from world-class historical and cultural sites like Petra and Jerash to modern entertainment in urban areas most notably Amman. Moreover, seaside recreation is present in Aqaba and Dead Sea through numerous international resorts. Eco-tourists have numerous nature reserves to choose from as like Dana Nature Reserve. Religious tourists visit Mt. Nebo, the Baptist Site, and the mosaic city of Madaba.

Jordan has nightclubs, discothques and bars in Amman, Irbid, Aqaba, and many 4 and 5-star hotels. Furthermore, beach clubs are also offered at the Dead Sea and Aqaba. Jordan played host to the Petra Prana Festival in 2007 which celebrated Petras win as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World with world-renowned DJs like Tiesto and Sarah Main. The annual Distant Heat festival in Wadi Rum and Aqaba ranked as one of the worlds top 10 raves.

====Medical tourism====
Jordan has been a medical tourism destination in the Middle East since the 1970s. A study conducted by Private Hospitals Association (Jordan)|Jordans Private Hospitals Association (PHA) found that 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in the kingdom in 2010, compared to 190,000 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue. It is the regions top medical tourism destination as rated by the World Bank, and fifth in the world overall.   

It is estimated that Jordan received 50,000 Libyan patients and 80,000 Syrian refugees, who also sought treatment in Jordanian hospitals, in the first six months of 2012. 

Jordans main focus of attention in its marketing effort are the ex-Soviet states, Europe, and America.  Most common medical procedures on Arab and foreign patients included organ transplants, open heart surgeries, infertility treatment, laser vision corrections, bone operations and cancer treatment.
